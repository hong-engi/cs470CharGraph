Adam walked into the room, his coat soaked from the sudden rain.
Betty looked up from the book and smiled. "You made it," Betty said.
They both sat near the fireplace, warming their hands in silence.

Caren entered next, shaking off the cold. "You two started without me?"
Adam chuckled. "Youâ€™re always late, Caren."
The three of them laughed, the warmth finally returning to their faces.

David knocked on the door before stepping in. "Am I too late for the tea?"
Betty poured another cup and handed it to David.
They all sat together, the fire crackling quietly.

Later, Adam and David took a walk around the garden.
Caren joined them, asking about the plans for tomorrow.
They discussed hiking trails and which one had the best view.

Back inside, Betty wrote in a journal while David played the piano softly.
Adam and Caren stood by the window, watching the rain begin again.
The storm outside echoed faintly through the glass.

At dinner, Adam and Betty sat side by side, while Caren and David debated philosophy.
"You're both impossible," Betty laughed, pointing a fork at them.
The candlelight flickered across everyone's faces.

After dinner, Caren and Adam washed the dishes while Betty dried them.
David disappeared for a while and returned with a sketchpad.
Everyone gathered around David, admiring the portrait of the group.

As the night deepened, Betty and Caren shared stories from their childhood.
Adam and David listened, occasionally adding their own memories.
The house was still, except for their laughter.

Eventually, they all moved to the couch, too tired to talk.
Adam rested against Betty's shoulder, while Caren leaned on David.
Outside, the wind howled, but inside, they were at peace.
