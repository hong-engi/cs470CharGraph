문장: The _Dazzler_ turned on The _Dazzler_'s heel like a
race-horse, and swept into the wind, The _Dazzler_'s canvas snarling and The _Dazzler_'s sheets
slatting like hail.
"Draw down the jib-sheet!"

Joe obeyed, and, the head-sail filling, forced The _Dazzler_ off on the other tack.
This manoeuver had turned French Pete's bunk from the lee to the weather
side, and rolled French Pete's out on the cabin floor, where French Pete's lay in a drunken
stupor.

문장: The lights of Oakland had dwindled till The lights of Oakland made only a hazy flare
against the sky; but to the south the San Francisco lights, topping
hills and sinking into valleys, stretched miles upon miles.
Starting
from the great ferry building, and passing on to Telegraph Hill, Joe
was soon able to locate the principal places of the city.
Somewhere
over in that maze of light and shadow was the home of Joe's father, and
perhaps even now they were thinking and worrying about Joe; and over
there Bessie was sleeping cozily, to wake up in the morning and wonder
why Bessie's did not come down to breakfast.
