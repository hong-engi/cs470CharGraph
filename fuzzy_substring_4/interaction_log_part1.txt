문장: This did not increase I's happiness, for your English was the only study of

And, while I stood thus a silent picture of misery and disgrace,
Mr. Bronson looked upon I through the eyes of I's own boyhood with
an understanding which I could not have believed possible.
"However, what I need just now is not a discourse, but a bath and
court-plaster and witch-hazel and cold-water bandages," Mr. Bronsonsaid; "so to bed with I. I 'll need all the sleep I can get,
and I 'll feel stiff and sore to-morrow morning, Mr. Bronson promise I."

The clock struck one as I pulled the bedclothes around I; and the
next I knew I was being worried by a soft, insistent rapping, which
seemed to continue through several centuries, until at last, unable to
endure a soft, insistent rapping, which
seemed to continue through several centuries longer, I opened I's eyes and sat up.
