CHAPTER I

THE SWORD OF SOLOMON

The current of our story takes us once more to the White Castle at the mouth of the Sweet Waters of Asia.
It is the twenty-fifth of March, 1452.
The weather, for some days cloudy and tending to the tempestuous, changed at noon, permitting the sun to show himself in a field of spotless blue.
At the edge of the mountainous steep above Roumeli Hissar, the day-giver lingered in his going down, as loath to leave the life concentrated in the famous narrows in front of the old Castle.
On the land, there was an army in waiting; therefore the city of tents and brushwood booths extending from the shore back to the hills, and the smoke pervading the perspective in every direction.
On the water, swinging to each other, crowding all the shallows of the delta of the little river, reaching out into the sweep of the Bosphorus, boats open and boats roofed--scows, barges, galleys oared and galleys with masts--ships--a vast conglomerate raft.
About the camp, and to and fro on the raft, men went and came, like ants in storing time.
Two things, besides the locality, identified them--their turbans, and the crescent and star in the red field of the flags they displayed.
History, it would appear, takes pleasure in repetition.
Full a thousand years before this, a greater army had encamped on the banks of the same Sweet Waters.
Then it was of Persians; now it is of Turks; and curiously there are no soldiers to be seen, but only working men, while the flotilla is composed of carrying vessels; here boats laden with stone; there boats with lime; yonder boats piled high with timber.
At length the sun, drawing the last ravelling of light after it, disappeared.
About that time, the sea gate in front of the Palace of Julian down at Constantinople opened, and a boat passed out into the Marmora.
Five men plied the oars.
Two sat near the stern.
These latter were Count Corti and Ali, son of Abed-din the Faithful.
Two hours prior, Ali, with a fresh catch of fish, entered the gate, and finding no purchaser in the galley, pushed on to the landing, and thence to the Palace.
"O Emir," he said, when admitted to the Count, "the Light of the World, our Lord Mahommed is arrived."
The intelligence seemed to strike the Count with a sudden ague.
"Where is he?"
he asked, his voice hollow as from a closed helmet.
Ere the other could answer, he added a saving clause: "May the love of Allah be to him a staff of life!"
"He is at the White Castle with Mollahs, Pachas, and engineers a host.... What a way they were in, rushing here and there, like squealing swine, and hunting quarters, if but a crib to lie in and blow!
Shintan take them, beards, boots, and turbans!
So have they lived on fat things, slept on divans of down under hangings of silk, breathed perfumed airs in crowded harems, Heaven knows if now they are even fit to stop an arrow.
They thought the old Castle of Bajazet-Ilderim another Jehan-Numa.
By the delights of Paradise, O Emir--ha, ha, ha!--it was good to see how little the Light of the World cared for them!
At the Castle, he took in with him for household the ancient _Gabour_ Ortachi-Khalil and a Prince of India, whom he calls his Messenger of the Stars; the rest were left to shift for themselves till their tents arrive.
Halting the Incomparables, [Footnote: Janissaries.]
out beyond Roumeli-Hissar, he summoned the Three Tails, [Footnote: Pachas.]
nearly dead from fatigue, having been in the saddle since morning, and rode off with them fast as his Arab could gallop across the country, and down the long hill behind Therapia, drawing rein at the gate before the Palace of the Princess Irene."
"The Palace of the Princess Irene," the Count repeated.
"What did he there?"
"He dismounted, looked at the brass plate on the gate-post, went in, and asked if she were at home.
Being told she was yet in the city, he said: 'A message for her to be delivered to-night.
Here is a purse to pay for going.
Tell her Aboo-Obeidah, the Singing Sheik'--only the Prophet knows of such a Sheik--'has been here, bidden by Sultan Mahommed to see if her house had been respected, and inquire if she has yet her health and happiness.'
With that, he called for his horse, and went through the garden and up to the top of the promontory; then he returned to Hissar faster than he went to Therapia; and when, to take boat for the White Castle, he walked down the height, two of the Three Tails had to be lifted from their saddles, so nearly dead were they."
Here Ali stopped to laugh.
"Pardon me, O Emir," he resumed, "if I say last what I should have said first, it being the marrow of the bone I bring you.... Before sitting to his pilaf, our Lord Mahommed sent me here.
'Thou knowest to get in and out of the unbelieving city,' he said.
'Go privily to the Emir Mirza, and bid him come to me to-night.'"
"What now, Ali?"
"My Lord was too wise to tell me."
"It is a great honor, Ali.
I shall get ready immediately."
When the night was deep enough to veil the departure, the Count seated himself in the fisher's boat, a great cloak covering his armor.
Half a mile below the Sweet Waters the party was halted.
"What is this, Ali?"
"The Lord Mahommed's galleys of war are down from the Black Sea.
These are their outlyers."
At the side of one of the vessels, the Count showed the Sultan's signet, and there was no further interruption.
A few words now with respect to Corti.
He had become a Christian.
Next, the bewilderment into which the first sight of the Princess Irene had thrown him instead of passing off had deepened into hopeless love.
And farther--Constantine, a genuine knight himself; in fact more knight than statesman; delighting in arms, armor, hounds, horses, and martial exercises, including tournaments, hawking, and hunting, found one abiding regret on his throne--he could have a favorite but never a comrade.
The denial only stimulated the desire, until finally he concluded to bring the Italian to Court for observation and trial, his advancement to depend upon the fitness, tact, and capacity he might develop.
One day an order was placed in the Count's hand, directing him to find quarters at Blacherne.
The Count saw the honor intended, and discerned that acceptance would place him in better position to get information for Mahommed, but what would the advantage avail if he were hindered in forwarding his budget promptly?
No, the mastership of the gate was of most importance; besides which the seclusion of the Julian residence was so favorable to the part he was playing; literally he had no one there to make him afraid.
Upon receipt of the order he called for his horse, and rode to Blacherne, where his argument of the necessity of keeping the Moslem crew of his galley apart brought about a compromise.
His Majesty would require the Count's presence during the day, but permit him the nights at Julian.
He was also allowed to retain command of the gate.
A few months then found him in Constantine's confidence, the imperial favorite.
Yet more surprising as a coincidence, he actually became to the Emperor what he had been to Mahommed.
He fenced and jousted with him, instructed him in riding, trained him to sword and bow.
Every day during certain hours he had his new master's life at mercy.
With a thrust of sword, stroke of battle-axe, or flash of an arrow, it was in his power to rid Mahommed of an opponent concerning whom he wrote: "O my Lord, I think you are his better, yet if ever you meet him in personal encounter, have a care."
But the unexpected now happened to the Count.
He came to have an affection for this second lord which seriously interfered with his obligations to the first one.
Its coming about was simple.
Association with the Greek forced a comparison with the Turk.
The latter's passion was a tide before which the better gifts of God to rulers--mercy, justice, discrimination, recognition of truth, loyalty, services--were as willows in the sweep of a wave.
Constantine, on the other hand, was thoughtful, just, merciful, tender-hearted, indisposed to offend or to fancy provocation intended.
The difference between a man with and a man without conscience--between a king all whose actuations are dominated by religion and a king void of both conscience and religion--slowly but surely, we say, the difference became apparent to the Count, and had its inevitable consequences.
Such was the Count's new footing in Blacherne.
The changes wrought in his feeling were forwarded more than he was aware by the standing accorded him in the reception-room of the Princess Irene.
After the affair at the Cynegion he had the delicacy not to push himself upon the attention of the noble lady.
In preference he sent a servant every morning to inquire after her health.
Ere long he was the recipient of an invitation to come in person; after which his visits increased in frequency.
Going to Blacherne, and coming from it, he stopped at her house, and with every interview it seemed his passion for her intensified.
Now it were not creditable to the young Princess' discernment to say she was blind to his feeling; yet she was careful to conceal the discovery from him, and still more careful not to encourage his hope.
She placed the favor shown him to the account of gratitude; at the same time she admired him, and was deeply interested in the religious sentiment he was beginning to manifest.
In the Count's first audience after the rescue from the lion, she explained how she came to be drawn to the Cynegion.
This led to detail of her relations with Sergius, concluding with the declaration: "I gave him the signal to speak in Sancta Sophia, and felt I could not live if he died the death, sent to it by me."
"Princess," the Count replied, "I heard the monk's sermon in Sancta Sophia, but did not know of your giving the signal.
Has any one impugned your motive in going to the Cynegion?
Give me his name.
My sword says you did well."
"Count Corti, the Lord has taken care of His own."
"As you say, Princess Irene.
Hear me before addressing yourself to something else....
I remember the words of the Creed--or if I have them wrong correct me: 'I believe in God, and Jesus Christ, his Son.'"
"It is word for word."
"Am I to understand you gave him the form?"
"The idea is Father Hilarion's."
"And the Two Articles.
Are they indeed sayings of Jesus Christ?"
"Even so."
"Give me the book containing them."
Taking a New Testament from the table, she gave it to him.
"You will find the sayings easily.
On the margins opposite them there are markings illuminated in gold."
"Thanks, O Princess, most humbly.
I will return the book."
"No, Count, it is yours."
An expression she did not understand darkened his face.
"Are you a Christian?"
she asked.
He flushed deeply, and bowed while answering:

"My mother is a Christian."
That night Count Corti searched the book, and found that the strength of faith underlying his mother's prayers for his return to her, and the Princess' determination to die with the monk, were but Christian lights.
"Princess Irene," he said one day, "I have studied the book you gave me; and knowing now who Christ is, I am ready to accept your Creed.
Tell me how I may know myself a believer?"
A lamp in the hollow of an alabaster vase glows through the transparency; so her countenance responded to the joy behind it.
"Render obedience to His commands--do His will, O Count--then wilt thou be a believer in Christ, and know it."
The darkness she had observed fall once before on his face obscured it again, and he arose and went out in silence.
Brave he certainly was, and strong.
Who could strike like him?
He loved opposition for the delight there was in overcoming it; yet in his chamber that night he was never so weak.
He resorted to the book, but could not read.
It seemed to accuse him.
"Thou Islamite--thou son of Mahomet, though born of a Christian, whom servest thou?
Judas, what dost thou in this city?
Hypocrite--traitor--which is thy master, Mahomet or Christ?"
He fell upon his knees, tore at his beard, buried his head in his arms.
He essayed prayer to Christ.
"Jesus--Mother of Jesus--O my mother!"
he cried in agony.
The hour he was accustomed to give to Mahommed came round.
He drew out the writing materials.
"The Princess"--thus he began a sentence, but stopped--something caught hold of his heart--the speaking face of the beloved woman appeared to him--her eyes were reproachful--her lips moved--she spoke: "Count Corti, I am she whom thou lovest; but what dost thou?
Is it not enough to betray my kinsman?
Thy courage--what makest thou of it but wickedness?
... Write of me to thy master.
Come every day, and contrive that I speak, then tell him of it.
Am I sick?
Tell him of it.
Do I hold to this or that?
Tell him.
Am I shaken by visions of ruin to my country?
Tell him of them.
What is thy love if not the servant for hire of his love?
Traitor--panderer!"
The Count pushed the table from him, and sprang to foot writhing.
To shut out the word abhorrent above all other words, he clapped his hands tight over his ears--in vain.
"Panderer!"
--he heard with his soul--"Panderer!
When thou hast delivered me to Mahommed, what is he to give thee?
How much?"
Thus shame, like a wild dog, bayed at him.
For relief he ran out into the garden.
And it was only the beginning of misery.
Such the introduction or first chapter, what of the catastrophe?
He could not sleep for shame.
In the morning he ordered his horse, but had not courage to go to Blacherne.
How could he look at the kindly face of the master he was betraying?
He thought of the Princess.
Could he endure her salutation?
She whom he was under compact to deliver to Mahommed?
A paroxysm of despair seized him.
He rode to the Gate St. Romain, and out of it into the country.
Gallop, gallop--the steed was good--his best Arab, fleet and tireless.
Noon overtook him--few things else could--still he galloped.
The earth turned into a green ribbon under the flying hoofs, and there was relief in the speed.
The air, whisked through, was soothing.
At length he came to a wood, wild and interminable, Belgrade, though he knew it not, and dismounting by a stream, he spent the day there.
If now and then the steed turned its eyes upon him, attracted by his sighs, groans and prayer, there was at least no accusation in them.
The solitude was restful; and returning after nightfall, he entered the city through the sortie under the Palace of Blacherne known as the Cercoporta.
It is well pain of spirit has its intermissions; otherwise long life could not be; and if sleep bring them, so much the better.
Next day betimes, the Count was at Blacherne.
"I pray grace, O my Lord!"
he said, speaking to the question in the Emperor's look.
"Yesterday I had to ride.
This confinement in the city deadens me.
I rode all day."
The good, easy master sighed: "Would I had been with you, Count."
Thus he dismissed the truancy.
But with the Princess it was a lengthy chapter.
If the Emperor was never so gracious, she seemed never so charming.
He wrote to Mahommed in the evening, and walked the garden the residue of the night.
So weeks and months passed, and March came--even the night of the twenty-fifth, with its order from the Sultan to the White Castle--an interval of indecision, shame, and self-indictment.
How many plans of relief he formed who can say?
Suicide he put by, a very last resort.
There was also a temptation to cut loose from Mahommed, and go boldly over to the Emperor.
That would be a truly Christian enlistment for the approaching war; and aside from conformity to his present sympathies, it would give him a right to wear the Princess' favor on his helmet.
But a fear shook the resort out of mind.
Mahommed, whether successful or defeated, would demand an explanation of him, possibly an accounting.
He knew the Sultan.
Of all the schemes presented, the most plausible was flight.
There was the gate, and he its keeper, and beyond the gate, the sunny Italian shore, and his father's castle.
The seas and sailing between were as green landscapes to a weary prisoner, and he saw in them only the joy of going and freedom to do.
Welcome, and to God the praise!
More than once he locked his portables of greatest value in the cabin of the galley.
But alas!
He was in bonds.
Life in Constantinople now comprehended two of the ultimate excellencies to him, Princess Irene and Christ--and their joinder in the argument he took to be no offence.
From one to another of these projects he passed, and they but served to hide the flight of time.
He was drifting--ahead, and not far, he heard the thunder of coming events--yet he drifted.
In this condition, the most envied man in Constantinople and the most wretched, the Sultan's order was delivered to him by Ali.
The time for decision was come.
Tired--ashamed--angry with himself, he determined to force the end.
The Count arrived at the Castle, was immediately admitted to the Sultan; indeed, had he been less resolute, his master's promptitude would have been a circumstance of disturbing significance.
Observation satisfied him Mahommed was in the field; for with all his Epicureanism in times of peace, when a campaign was in progress the Conqueror resolved himself into a soldierly example of indifference to luxury.
In other words, with respect to furnishment, the interior of the old Castle presented its every day ruggedness.
One lamp fixed to the wall near the door of the audience chamber struggled with the murk of a narrow passage, giving to view an assistant chamberlain, an armed sentinel, and two jauntily attired pages in waiting.
Surrendering his sword to the chamberlain, the Count halted before the door, while being announced; at the same time, he noticed a man come out of a neighboring apartment clad in black velvet from head to foot, followed closely by a servant.
It was the Prince of India.
The mysterious person advanced slowly, his eyes fixed on the floor, his velvet-shod feet giving out no sound.
His air indicated deep reflection.
In previous encounters with him, the Count had been pleased; now his sensations were of repugnance mixed with doubt and suspicion.
He had not time to account for the change.
It may have had origin in the higher prescience sometimes an endowment of the spirit by which we stand advised of a friend or an enemy; most likely, however, it was a consequence of the curious tales abroad in Constantinople; for at the recognition up sprang the history of the Prince's connection with Lael, and her abandonment by him, the more extraordinary from the evidences of his attachment to her.
Up sprang also the opinion of universal prevalence in the city that he had perished in the great fire.
What did it all mean?
What kind of man was he?
The servant carried a package wrapped in gold-embroidered green silk.
Coming near, the Prince raised his eyes--stopped--smiled--and said:

"Count Corti--or Mirza the Emir--which have I the honor of meeting?"
In spite of the offence he felt, Corti blushed, such a flood of light did the salutation let in upon the falsity of his position.
Far from losing presence of mind, he perceived at once how intimately the Prince stood in the councils of the Sultan.
"The Lord Mahommed must be heard before I can answer," he returned, calmly.
In an instant the Prince became cordial.
"That was well answered," he said.
"I am pleased to have my judgment of you confirmed.
Your mission has been a trying one, but you have conducted it like a master.
The Lord Mahommed has thanked me many times that I suggested you for it.
He is impatient to see you.
We will go in together."
Mahommed, in armor, was standing by a table on which were a bare cimeter, a lamp brightly burning, and two large unrolled maps.
In one of the latter, the Count recognized Constantinople and its environs cast together from his own surveys.
Retired a few steps were the two Viziers, Kalil Pacha and his rival, Saganos Pacha, the Mollah Kourani, and the Sheik Akschem-sed-din.
The preaching of the Mollah had powerfully contributed to arousing the fanatical spirit of the Sultan's Mohammedan subjects.
The four were standing in the attitude usual to Turkish officials in presence of a superior, their heads bowed, their hands upon their stomachs.
In speaking, if they raised their eyes from the floor it was to shoot a furtive glance, then drop them again.
"This is the grand design of the work by which you will be governed," Mahommed said to the counsellors, laying the finger points of his right hand upon the map unknown to the Count, and speaking earnestly.
"You will take it, and make copies tonight; for if the stars fail not, I will send the masons and their workmen to the other shore in the morning."
The advisers saluted--it would be difficult to say which of them with the greatest unction.
Looking sharply at Kalil, the master asked: "You say you superintended the running of the lines in person?"
Kalil saluted separately, and returned: "My Lord may depend upon the survey."
"Very well.
I wait now only the indication of Heaven that the time is ripe for the movement.
Is the Prince of India coming?"
"I am here, my Lord."
Mahommed turned as the Prince spoke, and let his eyes rest a moment upon Count Corti, without a sign of recognition.
"Come forward, Prince," he said.
"What is the message you bring me?"
"My Lord," the Prince replied, after prostration, "in the Hebrew Scriptures there is a saying in proof of the influence the planets have in the affairs of men: 'Then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.'
Now art thou truly Sultan of Sultans.
To-morrow--the twenty-sixth of March--will be memorable amongst days, for then thou mayst begin the war with the perfidious Greek.
From four o'clock in the morning the stars which fought against Sisera will fight for Mahommed.
Let those who love him salute and rejoice."
The counsellors, dropping on their knees, fell forward, their faces on their hands.
The Prince of India did the same.
Count Corti alone remained standing, and Mahommed again observed him.
"Hear you," the latter said, to his officers.
"Go assemble the masons and their workmen, the masters of boats, and the chiefs charged with duties.
At four o'clock in the morning I will move against Europe.
The stars have said it, and their permission is my law.
Rise!"
As his associates were moving backward with repeated genuflections, the Prince of India spoke:

"O most favored of men!
Let them stay a moment."
At a sign from the Sultan they halted; thereupon the Prince of India beckoned Syama to come, and taking the package from his hands, he laid it on the table.
"For my Lord Mahommed," he said.
"What is it?"
Mahommed demanded.
"A sign of conquest.... My Lord knows King Solomon ruled the world in his day, its soul of wisdom.
At his death dominion did not depart from him.
The secret ministers in the earth, the air and the waters, obedient to Allah, became his slaves.
My Lord knows of whom I speak.
Who can resist them?
...
In the tomb of Hiram, King of Tyre, the friend of King Solomon, I found a sarcophagus.
It was covered with a model in marble of the Temple of the Hebrew Almighty God.
Removing the lid, lo!
the mummy of Hiram, a crown upon its head, and at its feet the sword of Solomon, a present without price.
I brought it away, resolved to give it to him whom the stars should elect for the overthrow of the superstitions devised by Jesus, the bastard son of Joseph the carpenter of Nazareth....
Undo the wrappings, Lord Mahommed."
The Sultan obeyed, and laying the last fold of the cloth aside, drew back staring, and with uplifted hands.
"Kalil--Kourani--Akschem-sed-din--all of you, come look.
Tell me what it is--it blinds me."
The sword of Solomon lay before them; its curved blade a gleam of splendor, its scabbard a mass of brilliants, its hilt a ruby so pure we may say it retained in its heart the life of a flame.
"Take it in hand, Lord Mahommed," said the Prince of India.
The young Sultan lifted the sword, and as he did so down a groove in its back a stream of pearls started and ran, ringing musically, and would not rest while he kept the blade in motion.
He was speechless from wonder.
"Now may my Lord march upon Constantinople, for the stars and every secret minister of Solomon will fight for him."
So saying, the Prince knelt before the Sultan, and laid his lips on the instep of his foot, adding: "Oh, my Lord!
with that symbol in hand, march, and surely as Tabor is among the mountains and Carmel by the sea, so surely Christ will give place to Mahomet in Sancta Sophia.
March at four o'clock."
And the counsellors left kisses on the same instep, and departed.
Thence through the night the noises of preparation kept the space between the hills of the narrows alive with echoes.
At the hour permitted by the stars--four o'clock--a cloud of boats cast loose from the Asiatic shore, and with six thousand laborers, handmen to a thousand master masons, crossed at racing speed to Europe.
"God is God, and Mahomet is his Prophet," they shouted.
The vessels of burden, those with lime, those with stone, those with wood, followed as they were called, and unloading, hauled out, to give place to others.
Before sun up the lines of the triangular fort whose walls near Roumeli-Hissar are yet intact, prospectively a landmark enduring as the Pyramids, were defined and swarming with laborers.
The three Pachas, Kalil, Sarudje, and Saganos, superintended each a side of the work, and over them all, active and fiercely zealous, moved Mahommed, the sword of Solomon in his hand.
And there was no lack of material for the structure extensive as it was.
Asia furnished its quota, and Christian towns and churches on the Bosphorus were remorselessly levelled for the stones in them; wherefore the outer faces of the curtains and towers are yet speckled with marbles in block, capital and column.
Thus Mahommed, taking his first step in the war so long a fervid dream, made sure of his base of operations.
On the twenty-eighth of August, the work completed, from his camp on the old Asometon promontory he reconnoitred the country up to the ditch of Constantinople, and on the first of September betook himself to Adrianople.
CHAPTER II

MAHOMMED AND COUNT CORTI MAKE A WAGER

Upon the retirement of the Prince of India and the counsellors, Mahommed took seat by the table, and played with the sword of Solomon, making the pearls travel up and down the groove in the blade, listening to their low ringing, and searching for inscriptions.
This went on until Count Corti began to think himself forgotten.
At length the Sultan, looking under the guard, uttered an exclamation--looked again--and cried out:

"O Allah!
It is true!--May I be forgiven for doubting him!--Come, Mirza, come see if my eyes deceive me.
Here at my side!"
The Count mastered his surprise, and was presently leaning over the Sultan's shoulder.
"You remember, Mirza, we set out together studying Hebrew.
Against your will I carried you along with me until you knew the alphabet, and could read a little.
You preferred Italian, and when I brought the learned men, and submitted to them that Hebrew was one of a family of tongues more or less alike, and would have sent you with them to the Sidonian coast for inscriptions, you refused.
Do you remember?"
"My Lord, those were the happiest days of my life."
Mahommed laughed.
"I kept you three days on bread and water, and let you off then because I could not do without you....
But for the matter now.
Under this guard--look--are not the brilliants set in the form of letters?"
Corti examined closely.
"Yes, yes; there are letters--I see them plainly--a name."
"Spell it."
"S-O-L-O-M-O-N."

"Then I have not deceived myself," Mahommed exclaimed.
"Nor less has the Prince of India deceived me."
He grew more serious.
"A marvellous man!
I cannot make him out.
The more I do with him the more incomprehensible he becomes.
The long past is familiar to him as the present to me.
He is continually digging up things ages old, and amazing me with them.
Several times I have asked him when he was born, and he has always made the same reply: 'I will tell when you are Lord of Constantinople.'
... How he hates Christ and the Christians!
...
This is indeed the sword of Solomon--and he found it in the tomb of Hiram, and gives it to me as the elect of the stars now.
Ponder it, O Mirza!
Now at the mid of the night in which I whistle up my dogs of war to loose them on the _Gabour_--How, Mirza--what ails you?
Why that change of countenance?
Is he not a dog of an unbeliever?
On your knees before me--I have more to tell you than to ask.
No, spurs are troublesome.
To the door and bid the keeper there bring a stool--and look lest the lock have an ear hanging to it.
Old Kalil, going out, though bowing, and lip-handing me, never took his eyes off you."
The stool brought, Corti was about to sit.
"Take off your cap"--Mahommed spoke sternly--"for as you are not the Mirza I sent away, I want to see your face while we talk.
Sit here, in the full of the light."
The Count seated, placed his hooded cap on the floor.
He was perfectly collected.
Mahommed fingered the ruby hilt while searching the eyes which as calmly searched his.
"How brave you are!"
the Sultan began, but stopped.
"Poor Mirza!"
he began again, his countenance softened.
One would have said some tender recollection was melting the shell of his heart.
"Poor Mirza!
I loved you better than I loved my father, better than I loved my brothers, well as I loved my mother--with a love surpassing all I ever knew but one, and of that we will presently speak.
If honor has a soul, it lives in you, and the breath you draw is its wine, purer than the first expressage of grapes from the Prophet's garden down by Medina.
Your eyes look truth, your tongue drips it as a broken honey-comb drips honey.
You are truth as God is God."
He was speaking sincerely.
"Fool--fool--that I let you go!--and I would not--no, by the rose-door of Paradise and the golden stairs to the House of Allah, I would not had I loved my full moon of full moons less.
She was parted from me; and with whose eyes could I see her so well as with yours, O my falcon?
Who else would report to me so truly her words?
Love makes men and lions mad; it possessed me; and I should have died of it but for your ministering.
Wherefore, O Mirza"--

The Count had been growing restive; now he spoke.
"My Lord is about committing himself to some pledge.
He were wise, did he hear me first."
"Perhaps so," the Sultan rejoined, uncertainly, but added immediately: "I will hear you."
"It is true, as my Lord said, I am not the Mirza he despatched to Italy.
The changes I have undergone are material; and in recounting them I anticipate his anger.
He sees before him the most wretched of men to whom death would be mercy."
"Is it so bad?
You were happy when you went away.
Was not the mission to your content?"
"My Lord's memory is a crystal cup from which nothing escapes--a cup without a leak.
He must recall how I prayed to stay with him."
"Yes, yes."
"My dread was prophetic."
"Tell me of the changes."
"I will--and truly as there is but one God, and he the father of life and maker of things.
First, then, the affection which at my going was my Lord's, and which gave me to see him as the Light of the World, and the perfection of glory in promise, is now divided."
"You mean there is another Light of the World?
Be it so, and still you leave me flattered.
How far you had to travel before finding the other!
Who is he?"
"The Emperor of the Greeks."
"Constantine?
Are his gifts so many and rich?
The next."
"I am a Christian."
"Indeed?
Perhaps you can tell me the difference between God and Allah.
Yesterday Kourani said they were the same."
"Nay, my Lord, the difference is between Christ and Mahomet."
"The mother of the one was a Jewess, the mother of the other an Arab--I see.
Go on."
The Count did not flinch.
"My Lord, great as is your love of the Princess Irene"--Mahommed half raised his hands, his brows knit, his eyes filled with fire, but the Count continued composedly--"mine is greater."
The Sultan recovered himself.
"The proof, the proof!"
he said, his voice a little raised.
"My love of her is consuming me, but I see you alive."
"My Lord's demand is reasonable.
I came here to make the avowal, and die.
Would my Lord so much?"
"You would die for the Princess?"
"My Lord has said it."
"Is there not something else in the urgency?"
"Yes--honor."
The Count's astonishment was unspeakable.
He expected an outburst of wrath unappeasable, a summons for an executioner; instead, Mahommed's eyes became humid, and resting his elbow on the table, and his face on the thumb and forefinger, he said, gazing sorrowfully:

"Ahmed was my little brother.
His mother published before my father's death, that my mother was a slave.
She was working for her child already, and I had him smothered in a bath.
Cruel?
God forgive me!
It was my duty to provide for the peace of my people.
I had a right to take care of myself; yet will I never be forgiven.
Kismet!...
I have had many men slain since.
I travel, going to mighty events beckoned by destiny.
The ordinary cheap soul cannot understand how necessary it is that my path should be smooth and clear; for sometime I may want to run; and he will amuse or avenge himself by stamping me in history a monster without a soul.
Kismet!
...
But you, my poor Mirza, you should know me better.
You are my brother without guile.
I am not afraid to love you.
I do love you.
Let us see....
Your letters from Constantinople--I have them all--told me so much more than you intended, I could not suspect your fidelity.
They prepared me for everything you have confessed.
Hear how in my mind I disposed of them point by point.... 'Mirza,' I said, 'pities the _Gabour_ Emperor; in the end he will love him.
Loving a hundred men is less miraculous in a man than loving one.
He will make comparisons.
Why not?
The _Gabour_ appeals to him through his weakness, I through my strength.
I would rather be feared than pitied.
Moreover, the _Gabour's_ day runs to its close, and as it closes, mine opens.
Pity never justified treason.'
... And I said, too, on reading the despatch detailing your adventures in Italy: 'Poor Mirza!
now has he discovered he is an Italian, stolen when a child, and having found his father's castle and his mother, a noble woman, he will become a Christian, for so would I in his place.'
Did I stop there?
The wife of the Pacha who received you from your abductors is in Broussa.
I sent to her asking if she had a keepsake or memento which would help prove your family and country.
See what she returned to me."
From under a cloth at the further end of the table, Mahommed drew a box, and opening it, produced a collar of lace fastened with a cameo pin.
On the pin there was a graven figure.
"Tell me, Mirza, if you recognize the engraving."
The Count took the cameo, looked at it, and replied, with a shaking voice:

"The arms of the Corti!
God be praised!"
"And here--what are these, and what the name on them?"
Mahommed gave him a pair of red morocco half-boots for a child, on which, near the tops, a name was worked in silk.
"It is mine, my Lord--my name--'Ugo.'"
He cast himself before the Sultan, and embraced his knees, saying, in snatches as best he could:

"I do not know what my Lord intends--whether he means I am to die or live--if it be death, I pray him to complete his mercy by sending these proofs to my mother"--

"Poor Mirza, arise!
I prefer to have your face before me."
Directly the Count was reseated, Mahommed continued:

"And you, too, love the Princess Irene?
You say you love her more than I?
And you thought I could not endure hearing you tell it?
That I would summon black Hassan with his bowstring?
With all your opportunities, your seeing and hearing her, as the days multiplied from tens to hundreds, is it for me to teach you she will come to no man except as a sacrifice?
What great thing have you to offer her?
While I--well, by this sword of Solomon, to-morrow morning I set out to say to her: 'For thy love, O my full Moon of full Moons, for thy love thou shalt have the redemption of thy Church.'...
And besides, did I not foresee your passion?
Courtiers stoop low and take pains to win favor; but no courtier, not even a professional, intending merely to please me, could have written of her as you did; and by that sign, O Mirza, I knew you were in the extremity of passion.
Offended?
Not so, not so!
I sent you to take care of her--fight for her--die, if her need were so great.
Of whom might I expect such service but a lover?
Did I not, the night of our parting, foretell what would happen?"
He paused gazing at the ruby of the ring on his finger.
"See, Mirza!
There has not been a waking hour since you left me but I have looked at this jewel; and it has kept color faithfully.
Often as I beheld it, I said: 'Mirza loves her because he cannot help it; yet he is keeping honor with me.
Mirza is truth, as God is God.
From his hand will I receive her in Constantinople'"--

"O my Lord"--

"Peace, peace!
The night wanes, and you have to return.
Of what was I speaking?
Oh, yes"--

"But hear me, my Lord.
At the risk of your displeasure I must speak."
"What is it?"
"In her presence my heart is always like to burst, yet, as I am to be judged in the last great day, I have kept faith with my Lord.
Once she thanked me--it was after I offered myself to the lion--O Heaven!
how nearly I lost my honor!
Oh, the agony of that silence!
The anguish of that remembrance!
I have kept the faith, my Lord.
But day by day now the will to keep it grows weaker.
All that holds me steadfast is my position in Constantinople.
What am I there?"
The Count buried his face in his hands, and through the links in his surcoat the tremor which shook his body was apparent.
Mahommed waited.
"What am I there?
Having come to see the goodness of the Emperor, I must run daily to betray him.
I am a Christian; yet as Judas sold his Master, I am under compact to sell my religion.
I love a noble woman, yet am pledged to keep her safely, and deliver her to another.
O my Lord, my Lord!
This cannot go on.
Shame is a vulture, and it is tearing me--my heart bleeds in its beak.
Release me, or give me to death.
If you love me, release me."
"Poor Mirza!"
"My Lord, I am not afraid."
Mahommed struck the table violently, and his eyes glittered.
"That ever one should think I loved a coward!
Yet more intolerable, that he whom I have called brother should know me so little!
Can it be, O Mirza, can it be, you tell me these things imagining them new to me?
... Let me have done.
What we are saying would have become us ten years ago, not now.
It is unmanly.
I had a purpose in sending for you....
Your mission in Constantinople ends in the morning at four o'clock.
In other words, O Mirza, the condition passes from preparation for war with the _Gabour_ to war.
Observe now.
You are a fighting man--a knight of skill and courage.
In the rencounters to which I am going--the sorties, the assaults, the duels single and in force, the exchanges with all arms, bow, arbalist, guns small and great, the mines and countermines--you cannot stay out.
You must fight.
Is it not so?"
Corti's head arose, his countenance brightened.
"My Lord, I fear I run forward of your words--forgive me."
"Yes, give ear....
The question now is, whom will you fight--me or the _Gabour?_"

"O my Lord"--

"Be quiet, I say.
The issue is not whether you love me less.
I prefer you give him your best service."
"How, my Lord?"
"I am not speaking in contempt, but with full knowledge of your superiority with weapons--of the many of mine who must go down before you.
And that you may not be under restraint of conscience or arm-tied in the melee, I not only conclude your mission, but release you from every obligation to me."
"Every obligation!"
"I know my words, Emir, yet I will leave nothing uncertain.... You will go back to the city free of every obligation to me--arm-free, mind-free.
Be a Christian, if you like.
Send me no more despatches advisory of the Emperor"--

"And the Princess Irene, my Lord?"
Mahommed smiled at the Count's eagerness.
"Have patience, Mirza.... Of the moneys had from me, and the properties heretofore mine in trust, goods, horses, arms, armor, the galley and its crew, I give them to you without an accounting.
You cannot deliver them to me or dispose of them, except with an explanation which would weaken your standing in Blacherne, if not undo you utterly.
You have earned them."
Corti's face reddened.
"With all my Lord's generosity, I cannot accept this favor.
Honor"--

"Silence, Emir, and hear me.
I have never been careless of your honor.
When you set out for Italy, preparatory to the mission at Constantinople, you owed me duty, and there was no shame in the performance; but now--so have the changes wrought--that which was honorable to Mirza the Emir is scandalous to Count Corti.
After four o'clock you will owe me no duty; neither will you be in my service.
From that hour Mirza, my falcon, will cease to be.
He will have vanished.
Or if ever I know him more, it will be as Count Corti, Christian, stranger, and enemy."
"Enemy--my Lord's enemy?
Never!"
The Count protested with extended arms.
"Yes, circumstances will govern.
And now the Princess Irene."
Mahommed paused; then, summoning his might of will, and giving it expression in a look, he laid a forcible hand on the listener's shoulder.
"Of her now....
I have devised a promotion for you, Emir.
After to-night we will be rivals."
Corti was speechless--he could only stare.
"By the rose-door of Paradise--the only oath fit for a lover--or, as more becoming a knight, by this sword of Solomon, Emir, I mean the rivalry to be becoming and just.
I have an advantage of you.
With women rank and riches are as candles to moths.
On the other side your advantage is double; you are a Christian, and may be in her eyes day after day.
And not to leave you in mean condition, I give you the moneys and property now in your possession; not as a payment--God forbid!--but for pride's sake--my pride.
Mahommed the Sultan may not dispute with a knight who has only a sword."
"I have estates in Italy."
"They might as well be in the moon.
I shall enclose Constantinople before you could arrange with the Jews, and have money enough to buy a feather for your cap.
If this were less true, comes then the argument: How can you dispose of the properties in hand, and quiet the gossips in the _Gabour's_ palace?
'Where are your horses?'
they will ask.
What answer have you?
'Where your galley?'
Answer.
'Where your Mohammedan crew?'
Answer."
The Count yielded the debate, saying: "I cannot comprehend my Lord.
Such thing was never heard of before."
"Must men be restrained because the thing they wish to do was never heard of before?
Shall I not build a mosque with five minarets because other builders stopped with three?
... To the sum of it all now.
Christian or Moslem, are you willing to refer our rivalry for the young woman to God?"
"My wonder grows with listening to my Lord."
"Nay, this surprises you because it is new.
I have had it in mind for months.
It did not come to me easily.
It demanded self-denial--something I am unused to....
Here it is--I am willing to call Heaven in, and let it decide whether she shall be mine or yours--this lily of Paradise whom all men love at sight.
Dare you as much?"
The soldier spirit arose in the Count.
"Now or then, here or there, as my Lord may appoint.
I am ready.
He has but to name his champion."
"I protest.
The duel would be unequal.
As well match a heron and a hawk.
There is a better way of making our appeal.
Listen....
The walls of Constantinople have never succumbed to attack.
Hosts have dashed against them, and fled or been lost.
It may be so with me; but I will march, and in my turn assault them, and thou defending with thy best might.
If I am beaten, if I retire, be the cause of failure this or that, we--you and I, O Mirza--will call it a judgment of Heaven, and the Princess shall be yours; but if I success and enter the city, it shall be a judgment no less, and then"--Mahommed's eyes were full of fire--"then"--

"What then, my Lord?"
"Thou shalt see to her safety in the last struggle, and conduct her to Sancta Sophia, and there deliver her to me as ordered by God."
Corti was never so agitated.
He turned pale and red--he trembled visibly.
Mahommed asked mockingly: "Is it Mirza I am treating with, or Count Corti?
Are Christians so unwilling to trust God?"
"But, my Lord, it is a wager you offer me."
"Call it so."
"And its conditions imply slavery for the Princess.
Change them, my Lord--allow her to be consulted and have her will, be the judgment this or that."
Mahommed clinched his hands.
"Am I a brute?
Did ever woman lay her head on my breast perforce?"
The Count replied, firmly:

"Such a condition would be against us both alike."
The Sultan struggled with himself a moment.
"Be it so," he rejoined.
"The wager is my proposal, and I will go through with it.
Take the condition, Emir.
If I win, she shall come to me of her free will or not at all."
"A wife, my Lord?"
"In my love first, and in my household first--my Sultana."
The animation which then came to the Count was wonderful.
He kissed Mahommed's hand.
"Now has my Lord outdone himself in generosity.
I accept.
In no other mode could the issue be made so absolutely a determination of Heaven."
Mahommed arose.
"We are agreed.--The interview is finished.--Ali is waiting for you."
He replaced the cover on the box containing the collar and the half-boots.
"I will send these to the Countess your mother; for hereafter you are to be to me Ugo, Count Corti.... My falcon hath cast its jess and hood.
Mirza is no more.
Farewell Mirza."
Corti was deeply moved.
Prostrating himself, he arose, and replied:

"I go hence more my Lord's lover than ever.
Death to the stranger who in my presence takes his name in vain."
As he was retiring, Mahommed spoke again:

"A word, Count....
In what we are going to, the comfort and safety of the Princess Irene may require you to communicate with me.
You have ready wit for such emergencies.
Leave me a suggestion."
Corti reflected an instant.
"The signal must proceed from me," he said.
"My Lord will pitch his tent in sight"--

"By Solomon, and this his sword, yes!
Every _Gabour_ who dares look over the wall shall see it while there is a hill abiding."
The Count bowed.
"I know my Lord, and give him this--God helping me, I will make myself notorious to the besiegers as he will be to the besieged.
If at any time he sees my banderole, or if it be reported to him, let him look if my shield be black; if so, he shall come himself with a shield the color of mine, and place himself in my view.
My Lord knows I make my own arrows.
If I shoot one black feathered, he must pick it up.
The ferrule will be of hollow lead covering a bit of scrip."
"Once more, Count Corti, the issue is with God.
Good night."
Traversing the passage outside the door, the Count met the Prince of India.
"An hour ago I would have entitled you Emir: but now"--the Prince smiled while speaking--"I have stayed to thank Count Corti for his kindness to my black friend Nilo."
"Your servant?"
"My friend and ally--Nilo the King....
If the Count desires to add to the obligation, he will send the royal person to me with Ali when he returns to-night."
"I will send him."
"Thanks, Count Corti."
The latter lingered, gazing into the large eyes and ruddy face, expecting at least an inquiry after Lael.
He received merely a bow, and the words: "We will meet again."
Night was yet over the city, when Ali, having landed the Count, drew out of the gate with Nilo.
The gladness of the King at being restored to his master can be easily fancied.
CHAPTER III

THE BLOODY HARVEST

In June, a few days after the completion of the enormous work begun by Mahommed on the Asometon promontory, out of a gate attached to the High Residence of Blacherne, familiarly known as the Caligaria, there issued a small troop of horsemen of the imperial military establishment.
The leader of this party--ten in all--was Count Corti.
Quite a body of spectators witnessed the exit, and in their eyes he was the most gallant knight they had ever seen.
They cheered him as, turning to the right after issuance from the gate, he plunged at a lively trot into the ravine at the foot of the wall, practically an immense natural fosse.
"God and our Lady of Blacherne," they shouted, and continued shouting while he was in sight, notwithstanding he did not so much as shake the banderole on his lance in reply.
Of the Count's appearance this morning it is unnecessary to say more than that he was in the suit of light armor habitual to him, and as an indication of serious intent, bore, besides the lance, a hammer or battle-axe fixed to his saddle-bow, a curved sword considerably longer, though not so broad as a cimeter, a bow and quiver of arrows at his back, and a small shield or buckler over the quiver.
The favorite chestnut Arab served him for mount, its head and neck clothed in flexible mail.
The nine men following were equipped like himself in every particular, except that their heads were protected by close-fitting conical caps, and instead of armor on their legs, they wore flowing red trousers.
Of them it may be further remarked, their mode of riding, due to their short stirrups, was indicative of folk akin to the Bedouin of the Desert.
Upon returning from the last interview with Mahommed in the White Castle, the Count had subjected the crew of his galley to rigorous trial of fitness for land service.
Nine of them he found excellent riders after their fashion, and selecting them as the most promising, he proceeded to instruct them in the use of the arms they were now bearing.
His object in this small organization was a support to rush in after him rather than a battle front.
That is, in a charge he was to be the lance's point, and they the broadening of the lance's blade; while he was engaged, intent on the foe before him, eight of them were to guard him right and left, and, as the exigencies of combat might demand, open and close in fan-like movement.
The ninth man was a fighter in their rear.
In the simple manoeuvring of this order of battle he had practised them diligently through the months.
The skill attained was remarkable; and the drilling having been in the Hippodrome, open to the public, the concourse to see it had been encouraging.
In truth, the wager with Mahommed had supplied the Count with energy of body and mind.
He studied the chances of the contest, knowing how swiftly it was coming, and believed it possible to defend the city successfully.
At all events, he would do his best, and if the judgment were adverse, it should not be through default on his part.
The danger--and he discerned it with painful clearness--was in the religious dissensions of the Greeks; still he fancied the first serious blow struck by the Turks, the first bloodshed, would bring the factions together, if only for the common safety.
It is well worth while here to ascertain the views and feelings of the people whom Count Corti was thus making ready to defend.
This may be said of them generally: It seemed impossible to bring them to believe the Sultan really intended war against the city.
"What if he does?"
they argued.
"Who but a young fool would think of such a thing?
If he comes, we will show him the banner of the Blessed Lady from the walls."
If in the argument there was allusion to the tower on the Asometon heights, so tall one could stand on its lead-covered roof, and looking over the intermediate hills, almost see into Constantinople, the careless populace hooted at the exaggeration: "There be royal idiots as well as every-day idiots.
Staring at us is one thing, shooting at us is another.
Towers with walls thirty feet thick are not movable."
One day a report was wafted through the gates that a gun in the water battery of the new Turkish fort had sunk a passing ship.
"What flag was the ship flying?"
"The Venetian."
"Ah, that settles it," the public cried.
"The Sultan wants to keep the Venetians out of the Black Sea.
The Turks and the Venetians have always been at war."
A trifle later intelligence came that the Sultan, lingering at Basch-Kegan, supposably because the air along the Bosphorus was better than the air at Adrianople, had effected a treaty by which the Podesta of Galata bound his city to neutrality; still the complacency of the Byzantines was in no wise disturbed.
"Score one for the Genoese.
It is good to hear of their beating the Venetians."
Occasionally a wanderer--possibly a merchant, more likely a spy--passing the bazaars of Byzantium, entertained the booth-keepers with stories of cannon being cast for the Sultan so big that six men tied together might be fired from them at once.
The Greeks only jeered.
Some said: "Oh, the Mahound must be intending a salute for the man in the moon of Ramazan!"
Others decided: "Well, he is crazier than we thought him.
There are many hills on the road to Adrianople, and at the foot of every hill there is a bridge.
To get here he must invent wings for his guns, and even then it will be long before they can be taught to fly."
At times, too, the old city was set agog with rumors from the Asiatic provinces opposite that the Sultan was levying unheard-of armies; he had half a million recruits already, but wanted a million.
"Oh, he means to put a lasting quietus on Huniades and his Hungarians.
He is sensible in taking so many men."
In compliment to the intelligence of the public, this obliviousness to danger had one fostering circumstance--the gates of the city on land and water stood open day and night.
"See," it was everywhere said, "the Emperor is not alarmed.
Who has more at stake than he?
He is a soldier, if he is an _azymite_.
He keeps ambassadors with the Sultan--what for, if not to be advised?"
And there was a great deal in the argument.
At length the Greek ambassadors were expelled by Mahommed.
It was while he lay at Basch-Kegan.
They themselves brought the news.
This was ominous, yet the public kept its spirits.
The churches, notably Sancta Sophia, were more than usually crowded with women; that was all, for the gates not only remained open, but traffic went in and out of them unhindered--out even to the Turkish camp, the Byzantines actually competing with their neighbors of Galata in the furnishment of supplies.
Nay, at this very period every morning a troop of the Imperial guard convoyed a wagon from Blacherne out to Basch-Kegan laden with the choicest food and wines; and to the officer receiving them the captain of the convoy invariably delivered himself: "From His Majesty, the Emperor of the Romans and Greeks, to the Lord Mahommed, Sultan of the Turks.
Prosperity and long life to the Sultan."
If these were empty compliments, if the relations between the potentates were slippery, if war were hatching, what was the Emperor about?
Six months before the fort opposite the White Castle was begun, Constantine had been warned of Mahommed's projected movement against his capital.
The warning was from Kalil Pacha; and whether Kalil was moved by pity, friendship, or avarice is of no moment; certain it is the Emperor acted upon the advice.
He summoned a council, and proposed war; but was advised to send a protesting embassy to the enemy.
A scornful answer was returned.
Seeing the timidity of his cabinet, cast upon himself, he resolved to effect a policy, and accordingly expostulated, prayed, sent presents, offered tribute, and by such means managed to satisfy his advisers; yet all the time he was straining his resources in preparation.
In the outset, he forced himself to face two facts of the gravest import: first, of his people, those of age and thews for fighting were in frocks, burrowing in monasteries; next, the clergy and their affiliates were his enemies, many openly preferring a Turk to an _azymite_.
A more discouraging prospect it is difficult to imagine.
There was but one hope left him.
Europe was full of professional soldiers.
Perhaps the Pope had influence to send him a sufficient contingent.
Would His Holiness interest himself so far?
The brave Emperor despatched an embassy to Rome, promising submission to the Papacy, and praying help in Christ's name.
Meantime his agents dispersed themselves through the Aegean, buying provisions and arms, enginery, and war material of all kinds.
This business kept his remnant of a navy occupied.
Every few days a vessel would arrive with stores for the magazine under the Hippodrome.
By the time the fort at Roumeli Hissar was finished, one of his anxieties was in a measure relieved.
The other was more serious.
Then the frequency with which he climbed the Tower of Isaac, the hours he passed there gazing wistfully southward down the mirror of the Marmora, became observable.
The valorous, knightly heart, groaning under the humiliations of the haughty Turk, weary not less of the incapacity of his own people to perceive their peril, and arise heroically to meet it, found opportunity to meditate while he was pacing the lofty lookout, and struggling to descry the advance of the expected succor.
In this apology the reader who has wondered at the inaction of the Emperor what time the Sultan was perfecting his Asiatic communications is answered.
There was nothing for him but a siege.
To that alternative the last of the Romans was reduced.
He could not promise himself enough of his own subjects to keep the gates, much less take the field.
The country around Constantinople was given to agriculture.
During the planting season, and the growing, the Greek husbandmen received neither offence nor alarm from the Turks.
But in June, when the emerald of the cornfields was turning to gold, herds of mules and cavalry horses began to ravage the fields, and the watchmen, hastening from their little huts on the hills to drive them out, were set upon by the soldiers and beaten.
They complained to the Emperor, and he sent an embassy to the Sultan praying him to save the crops from ruin.
In reply, Mahommed ordered the son of Isfendiar, a relative, to destroy the harvest.
The peasants resisted, and not unsuccessfully.
In the South, and in the fields near Hissar on the north, there were deaths on both sides.
Intelligence of the affair coming to Constantine, he summoned Count Corti.
"The long expected has arrived," he said.
"Blood has been shed.
My people have been attacked and slain in their fields; their bodies lie out unburied.
The war cannot be longer deferred.
It is true the succors from the Holy Father have not arrived; but they are on the way, and until they come we must defend ourselves.
Cold and indifferent my people have certainly been.
Now I will make a last effort to arouse them.
Go out toward Hissar, and recover the dead.
Have the bodies brought in just as they are.
I will expose them in the Hippodrome.
Perhaps their bruises and blood may have an effect; if not, God help this Christian city.
I will give you a force."
"Your Majesty," the Count replied, "such an expedition might provoke an advance upon the city before you are entirely prepared.
Permit me to select a party from my own men."
"As you choose.
A guide will accompany you."
To get to the uplands, so to speak, over which, north of Galata, the road to Hissar stretched, Corti was conducted past the Cynegion and through the districts of Eyoub to the Sweet Waters of Europe, which he crossed by a bridge below the site of the present neglected country palace of the Sultan.
Up on the heights he turned left of Pera, and after half an hour's rapid movement was trending northward parallel with the Bosphorus, reaches of which were occasionally visible through cleftings of the mountainous shore.
Straw-thatched farmhouses dotted the hills and slopes, and the harvest spread right and left in cheerful prospect.
The adventurer had ample time to think; but did little of it, being too full of self-gratulation at having before him an opportunity to recommend himself to the Emperor, with a possibility of earning distinction creditable in the opinion of the Princess Irene.
At length an exclamation of his guide aroused him to action.
"The Turks, the Turks!"
"Where?"
"See that smoke."
Over a hilltop in his front, the Count beheld the sign of alarm crawling slowly into the sky.
"Here is a village--to our left, but"--

"Have done," said Corti, "and get me to the fire.
Is there a nearer way than this?"
"Yes, under the hill yonder."
"Is it broken?"
"It narrows to a path, but is clear."
The Count spoke in Arabic to his followers, and taking the gallop, pushed the guide forward.
Shortly a party of terror-stricken peasants ran down toward him.
"Why do you run?
What is the matter?"
he asked.
"Oh, the Turks, the Turks!"
"What of them?
Stand, and tell me."
"We went to work this morning cutting corn, for it is now ripe enough.
The Mahounds broke in on us.
We were a dozen to their fifty or more.
We only escaped, and they set fire to the field.
O Christ, and the Most Holy Mother!
Let us pass, or we too will be slain!"
"Are they mounted?"
"Some have horses, some are afoot."
"Where are they now?"
"In the field on the hill."
"Well, go to the village fast as you can, and tell the men there to come and pick up their dead.
Tell them not to fear, for the Emperor has sent me to take care of them."
With that the Count rode on.
This was the sight presented him when he made the ascent: A wheat field sloping gradually to the northeast; fire creeping across it crackling, smoking, momentarily widening; through the cloud a company of Turkish soldiers halted, mostly horsemen, their arms glinting brightly in the noon sun; blackened objects, unmistakably dead men, lying here and there.
Thus the tale of the survivors of the massacre was confirmed.
Corti gave his lance with the banderole on it to the guide.
By direction his Berbers drove their lances into the earth that they might leave them standing, drew their swords, and brought their bucklers forward.
Then he led them into the field.
A few words more, directions probably, and he started toward the enemy, his followers close behind two and two, with a rear-guardsman.
He allowed no outcry, but gradually increased the pace.
There were two hundred and more yards to be crossed, level, except the slope, and with only the moving line of fire as an impediment.
The crop, short and thin, was no obstacle under the hoofs.
The Turks watched the movement herded, like astonished sheep.
They may not have comprehended that they were being charged, or they may have despised the assailants on account of their inferiority in numbers, or they may have relied on the fire as a defensive wall; whatever the reason, they stood passively waiting.
When the Count came to the fire, he gave his horse the spur, and plunging into the smoke and through the flame full speed, appeared on the other side, shouting: "Christ and Our Lady of Blacherne!"
His long sword flashed seemingly brighter of the passage just made.
Fleckings of flame clung to the horses.
What the battle-cry of the Berbers we may not tell.
They screamed something un-Christian, echoes of the Desert.
Then the enemy stirred; some drew their blades, some strung their bows; the footmen amongst them caught their javelins or half-spears in the middle, and facing to the rear, fled, and kept flying, without once looking over their shoulders.
One man mounted, and in brighter armor than the others, his steel cap surmounted with an immense white turban, a sparkling aigrette pinned to the turban, cimeter in hand, strove to form his companions--but it was too late.
"Christ and our Lady of Blacherne!"
--and with that Corti was in their midst; and after him, into the lane he opened, his Berbers drove pell-mell, knocking Turks from their saddles, and overthrowing horses--and there was cutting and thrusting, and wounds given, and souls rendered up through darkened eyes.
The killing was all on one side; then as a bowl splinters under a stroke, the Turkish mass flew apart, and went helter-skelter off, each man striving to take care of himself.
The Berbers spared none of the overtaken.
Spying the man with the showy armor, the Count made a dash to get to him, and succeeded, for to say truth, he was not an unwilling foeman.
A brief combat took place, scarcely more than a blow, and the Turk was disarmed and at mercy.
"Son of Isfendiar," said Corti, "the slaying these poor people with only their harvest knives for weapons was murder.
Why should I spare your life?"
"I was ordered to punish them."
"By whom?"
"My Lord the Sultan."
"Do your master no shame.
I know and honor him."
"Yesterday they slew our Moslems."
"They but defended their own.... You deserve death, but I have a message for the Lord Mahommed.
Swear by the bones of the Prophet to deliver it, and I will spare you."
"If you know my master, as you say, he is quick and fierce of temper, and if I must die, the stroke may be preferable at your hand.
Give me the message first."
"Well, come with me."
The two remained together until the flight and pursuit were ended; then, the fire reduced to patches for want of stalks to feed it, the Count led the way back to the point at which he entered the field.
Taking his lance from the guide, he passed it to the prisoner.
"This is what I would have you do," he said.
"The lance is mine.
Carry it to your master, the Lord Mahommed, and say to him, Ugo, Count Corti, salute him, and prays him to look at the banderole, and fix it in his memory.
He will understand the message, and be grateful for it.
Now will you swear?"
The banderole was a small flag of yellow silk, with a red moon in the centre, and on the face of the moon a white cross.
Glancing at it, the son of Isfendiar replied:

"Take off the cross, and you show me a miniature standard of the _Silihdars_, my Lord's guard of the Palace."
Then looking the Count full in the face, he added: "Under other conditions I should salute you Mirza, Emir of the Hajj."
"I have given you my name and title.
Answer."
"I will deliver the lance and message to my Lord--I swear it by the bones of the Prophet."
Scarcely had the Turk disappeared in the direction of Hissar, when a crowd of peasants, men and women, were seen coming timorously from the direction of the village.
The Count rode to meet them, and as they were provided with all manner of litters, by his direction the dead Greeks were collected, and soon, with piteous lamentations, a funeral cortege was on the road moving slowly to Constantinople.
Anticipating a speedy reappearance of the Turks, hostilities being now unavoidable, Count Corti despatched messengers everywhere along the Bosphorus, warning the farmers and villagers to let their fields go, and seek refuge in the city.
So it came about that the escort of the murdered peasants momentarily increased until at the bridge over the Sweet Waters of Europe it became a column composed for the most part of women, children, and old men.
Many of the women carried babies.
The old men staggered under such goods as they could lay their hands on in haste.
The able-bodied straggled far in the rear with herds of goats, sheep, and cattle; the air above the road rang with cries and prayers, and the road itself was sprinkled with tears.
In a word, the movement was a flight.
Corti, with his Berbers, lingered in the vicinity of the field of fight watchful of the enemy.
In the evening, having forwarded a messenger to the Emperor, he took stand at the bridge; and well enough, for about dusk a horde of Turkish militia swept down from the heights in search of plunder and belated victims.
At the first bite of his sword, they took to their heels, and were not again seen.
By midnight the settlements and farmhouses of the up-country were abandoned; almost the entire district from Galata to Fanar on the Black Sea was reduced to ashes.
The Greek Emperor had no longer a frontier or a province--all that remained to him was his capital.
Many of the fugitives, under quickening of the demonstration at the bridge, threw their burdens away; so the greater part of them at an early hour after nightfall appeared at the Adrianople gate objects of harrowing appeal, empty-handed, broken down, miserable.
Constantine had the funeral escort met at the gate by torch-bearers, and the sextons of the Blacherne Chapel.
Intelligence of the massacre, and that the corpses of the harvesters would be conveyed to the Hippodrome for public exposure, having been proclaimed generally through the city, a vast multitude was also assembled at the gate.
The sensation was prodigious.
There were twenty litters, each with a body upon it unwashed and in bloody garments, exactly as brought in.
On the right and left of the litters the torchmen took their places.
The sextons lit their long candles, and formed in front.
Behind trudged the worn, dust-covered, wretched fugitives; and as they failed to realize their rescue, and that they were at last in safety, they did not abate their lamentations.
When the innumerable procession passed the gate, and commenced its laborious progress along the narrow streets, seldom, if ever, has anything of the kind more pathetic and funereally impressive been witnessed.
Let be said what may, after all nothing shall stir the human heart like the faces of fellowmen done to death by a common enemy.
There was no misjudgment of the power of the appeal in this instance.
It is no exaggeration to say Byzantium was out assisting--so did the people throng the thoroughfares, block the street intersections, and look down from the windows and balconies.
Afar they heard the chanting of the sextons, monotonous, yet solemnly effective; afar they saw the swaying candles and torches; and an awful silence signalized the approach of the pageant; but when it was up, and the bodies were borne past, especially when the ghastly countenances of the sufferers were under eye plainly visible in the red torchlight, the outburst of grief and rage in every form, groans, curses, prayers, was terrible, and the amazing voice, such by unity of utterance, went with the dead, and followed after them until at last the Hippodrome was reached.
There the Emperor, on horseback, and with his court and guards, was waiting, and his presence lent nationality to the mournful spectacle.
Conducting the bearers of the litters to the middle of the oblong area, he bade them lay their burdens down, and summoned the city to the view.
"Let there be no haste," he said, "for, in want of their souls, the bruised bodies of our poor countrymen shall lie here all tomorrow, every gaping wound crying for vengeance.
Then on the next day it will be for us to say what we will do--fight, fly, or surrender."
Through the remainder of the night the work of closing the gates and making them secure continued without cessation.
The guards were strengthened at each of them, and no one permitted to pass out.
Singular to say, a number of eunuchs belonging to the Sultan were caught and held.
Some of the enraged Greeks insisted on their death; but the good heart of the Emperor prevailed, and the prisoners were escorted to their master.
The embassy which went with them announced the closing of the gates.
"Since neither oaths, nor treaty, nor submission can secure peace, pursue your impious warfare"--thus Constantine despatched to Mahommed.
"My trust is in God; if it shall please him to mollify your heart, I shall rejoice in the change; if he delivers the city in your hands, I submit without a murmur to his holy will.
But until he shall pronounce between us, it is my duty to live and die in defence of my people."
[Footnote: Gibbon]

Mahommed answered with a formal declaration of war.
It remains to say that the bodies of the harvesters were viewed as promised.
They lay in a row near the Twisted Serpent, and the people passed them tearfully; in the night they were taken away and buried.
Sadder still, the result did not answer the Emperor's hope.
The feeling, mixed of sorrow and rage, was loudly manifested; but it was succeeded by fear, and when the organization of companies was attempted, the exodus was shameful.
Thousands fled, leaving about one hundred thousand behind, not to fight, but firm in the faith that Heaven would take care of the city.
After weeks of effort, five thousand Greeks took the arms offered them, and were enrolled.
CHAPTER IV

EUROPE ANSWERS THE CRY FOR HELP

A man in love, though the hero of many battles, shall be afraid in the presence of his beloved, and it shall be easier for him to challenge an enemy than to ask her love in return.
Count Corti's eagerness to face the lion in the gallery of the Cynegion had established his reputation in Constantinople for courage; his recent defence of the harvesters raised it yet higher; now his name was on every tongue.
His habit of going about in armor had in the first days of his coming subjected him to criticism; for the eyes before which he passed belonged for the most part to a generation more given to prospecting for bezants in fields of peace than the pursuit of glory in the ruggeder fields of war.
But the custom was now accepted, and at sight of him, mounted and in glistening armor, even the critics smiled, and showered his head with silent good wishes, or if they spoke it was to say to each other: "Oh, that the Blessed Mother would send us more like him!"
And the Count knew he had the general favor.
We somehow learn such things without their being told us.
Up in the empyrean courtly circles his relations were quite as gratifying.
The Emperor made no concealment of his partiality, and again insisted on bringing him to Blacherne.
"Your Majesty," the Count said one day, "I have no further need of my galley and its crew.
I beg you to do with them as you think best."
Constantine received the offer gratefully.
"The galley is a godsend.
I will order payment for it.
Duke Notaras, the Grand Admiral, will agree with you about the price."
"If Your Majesty will permit me to have my way," the Count rejoined, "you will order the vessel into the harbor with the fleet, and if the result of the war is with Your Majesty, the Grand Admiral can arrange for the payment; if otherwise"--he smiled at the alternative--"I think neither Your Majesty nor myself will have occasion for a ship."
The galley was transferred from the Bay of Julian to anchorage in the Golden Horn.
That night, speaking of the tender, the Emperor said to Phranza: "Count Corti has cast his lot with us.
As I interpret him, he does not mean to survive our defeat.
See that he be charged to select a bodyguard to accompany me in action."
"Is he to be Captain of the guard?"
"Yes."
The duty brought the Count to Blacherne.
In a few days he had fifty men, including his nine Berbers.
These circumstances made him happy.
He found peace of mind also in his release from Mahommed.
Not an hour of the day passed without his silently thanking the Sultan for his magnanimity.
But no matter for rejoicing came to him like the privilege of freely attending the Princess Irene.
Not only was her reception-room open to him; whether she went to Blacherne or Sancta Sophia, he appeared in her train.
Often when the hour of prayer arrived, she invited him as one of her household to accompany her to the apartment she had set apart for chapel exercises; and at such times he strove to be devout, but in taking her for his pattern of conduct--as yet he hardly knew when to arise or kneel, or cross himself--if his thoughts wandered from the Madonna and Child to her, if sometimes he fell to making comparisons in which the Madonna suffered as lacking beauty--nay, if not infrequently he caught himself worshipping the living woman at the foot of the altar rather than the divinity above it, few there were who would have been in haste to condemn him even in that day.
There is nothing modern in the world's love of a lover.
By the treaty with Mahommed he was free to tell the Princess of his passion; and there were moments in which it seemed he must cast himself at her feet and speak; but then he would be seized with a trembling, his tongue would unaccountably refuse its office, and he would quiet himself with the weakling's plea--another time--to-morrow, to-morrow.
And always upon the passing of the opportunity, the impulse being laid with so many of its predecessors in the graveyard of broken resolutions--every swain afraid keeps such a graveyard--always he sallied from her door eager for an enemy on whom to vent his vexation.
"Ah," he would say, with prolonged emphasis upon the exclamation--"if Mahommed were only at the gate!
Is he never coming?"
One day he dismounted at the Princess' door, and was ushered into the reception-room by Lysander.
"I bring you good news," he said, in course of the conversation.
"What now?"
she asked.
"Every sword counts.
I am just from the Port of Blacherne, whither I accompanied the Grand Equerry to assist in receiving one John Grant, who has arrived with a following of Free Lances, mostly my own countrymen."
"Who is John Grant?"
"A German old in Eastern service; more particularly an expert in making and throwing hollow iron balls filled with inflammable liquid.
On striking, the balls burst, after which the fire is unquenchable with water."
"Oh!
our Greek fire rediscovered!"
"So he declares.
His Majesty has ordered him the materials he asks, and that he go to work to-morrow getting a store of his missiles ready.
The man declares also, if His Holiness would only proclaim a crusade against the Turks.
Constantinople has not space on her walls to hold the volunteers who would hasten to her defence.
He says Genoa, Venice, all Italy, is aroused and waiting."
"John Grant is welcome," the Princess returned; "the more so that His Holiness is slow."
Afterward, about the first of December, the Count again dismounted at her door with news.
"What is it now?"
she inquired.
"Noble Princess, His Holiness has been heard from."
"At last?"
"A Legate will arrive to-morrow."
"Only a Legate!
What is his name?"
"Isidore, Grand Metropolitan of Russia."
"Brings he a following?"
"No soldiers; only a suite of priests high and low."
"I see.
He comes to negotiate.
Alas!"
"Why alas?"
"Oh, the factions, the factions!"
she exclaimed, disconsolately; then, seeing the Count still in wonder, she added: "Know you not that Isidore, familiarly called the Cardinal, was appointed Metropolitan of the Russian Greek Church by the Pope, and, rejected by it, was driven to refuge in Poland?
What welcome can we suppose he will receive here?"
"Is he not a Greek?"
"Yes, truly; but being a Latin Churchman, the Brotherhoods hold him an apostate.
His first demand will be to celebrate mass in Sancta Sophia.
If the world were about shaking itself to pieces, the commotion would be but little greater than the breaking of things we will then hear.
Oh, it is an ill wind which blows him to our gates!"
Meantime the Hippodrome had been converted into a Campus Martius, where at all hours of the day the newly enlisted men were being drilled in the arms to which they were assigned; now as archers, now as slingers; now with balistas and catapults and arquebuses; now to the small artillery especially constructed for service on the walls.
And as trade was at an end in the city, as in fact martial preparation occupied attention to the exclusion of business in the commercial sense, the ancient site was a centre of resort.
Thither the Count hastened to work off the disheartenment into which the comments of the Princess had thrown him.
That same week, however, he and the loyal population of Constantinople in general, were cheered by a coming of real importance.
Early one morning some vessels of war hove in sight down the Marmora.
Their flags proclaimed them Christian.
Simultaneously the lookouts at Point Demetrius reported a number of Turkish galleys plying to and fro up the Bosphorus.
It was concluded that a naval battle was imminent.
The walls in the vicinity of the Point were speedily crowded with spectators.
In fact, the anxiety was great enough to draw the Emperor from his High Residence.
Not doubting the galleys were bringing him stores, possibly reinforcements, he directed his small fleet in the Golden Horn to be ready to go to their assistance.
His conjecture was right; yet more happily the Turks made no attempt upon them.
Turning into the harbor, the strangers ran up the flags of Venice and Genoa, and never did they appear so beautiful, seen by Byzantines--never were they more welcome.
The decks were crowded with helmed men who responded vigorously to the cheering with which they were saluted.
Constantine in person received the newcomers at the Port of Blacherne.
From the wall over the gate the Princess Irene, with an escort of noble ladies, witnessed the landing.
A knight of excellent presence stepped from a boat, and announced himself.
"I am John Justiniani of Genoa," he said, "come with two thousand companions in arms to the succor of the most Christian Emperor Constantine.
Guide me to him, I pray."
"The Emperor is here--I am he."
Justiniani kissed the hand extended to him, and returned with fervor:

"Christ and the Mother be praised!
Much have I been disquieted lest we should be too late.
Your Majesty, command me."
"Duke Notaras," said the Emperor, "assist this noble gentleman and his companions.
When they are disembarked, conduct them to me.
For the present I will lodge them in my residence."
Then he addressed the Genoese: "Duke Notaras, High Admiral of the Empire, will answer your every demand.
In God's name, and for the imperilled religion of our Redeeming Lord, I bid you welcome."
It seemed the waving of scarfs and white hands on the wall, and the noisy salutations of the people present, were not agreeable to the Duke; although coldly polite, he impressed Justiniani as an ill second to the stately but courteous Emperor.
At night there was an audience in the Very High Residence, and Justiniani assisted Phranza in the presentation of his companions; and though the banquet which shortly succeeded the audience may not, in the courses served or in its table splendors, have vied with those Alexis resorted to for the dazzlement of the chiefs of the first crusade, it was not entirely wanting in such particulars; for it has often happened, if the chronicles may be trusted, that the expiring light of great countries has lingered longest in their festive halls, just as old families have been known to nurture their pride in sparkling heirlooms, all else having been swept away.
The failings on this occasion, if any there were, Constantine more than amended by his engaging demeanor.
Soldier not less than Emperor, he knew to win the sympathy and devotion of soldiers.
Of his foreign guests that evening many afterwards died hardly distinguishing between him and the Holy Cause which led them to their fate.
The table was long, and without head or foot.
On one side, in the middle, the Emperor presided; opposite him sat the Princess Irene; and on their right and left, in gallant interspersion, other ladies, the wives and daughters of senators, nobles, and officials of the court, helped charm the Western chivalry.
And of the guests, the names of a few have been preserved by history, together with the commands to which they were assigned in the siege.
There was Andrew Dinia, under Duke Notaras, a captain of galleys.
There was the Venetian Contarino, intrusted with the defence of the Golden Grate.
There was Maurice Cataneo, a soldier of Genoa, commandant of the walls on the landward side between the Golden Gate and the Gate Selimbria.
There were two brothers, gentlemen of Genoa,

Paul Bochiardi and Antonin Troilus Bochiardi, defendants of the Adrianople Gate.
There was Jerome Minotte, Bayle of Venice, charged with safe keeping the walls between the Adrianople Gate and the Cerco Portas.
There was the artillerist, German John Grant, who, with Theodore Carystos, made sure of the Gate Charsias.
There was Leonardo de Langasco, another Genoese, keeper of the Wood Gate.
There was Gabriel Travisan; with four hundred other Venetians, he maintained the stretch of wall on the harbor front between Point Demetrius and the Port St. Peter.
There was Pedro Guiliani, the Spanish Consul, assigned to the guardianship of the wall on the sea side from Point Demetrius to the Port of Julian.
There also was stout Nicholas Gudelli; with the Emperor's brother, he commanded the force in reserve.
Now these, or the major part of them, may have been Free Lances; yet they did not await the motion of Nicholas, the dilatory Pope, and were faithful, and to-day exemplify the saying:

"That men may rise on stepping-stones     Of their dead selves to higher things."
CHAPTER V

COUNT CORTI RECEIVES A FAVOR

"Gracious Princess, the Italian, Count Corti, is at the door.
He prays you to hear a request from him."
"Return, Lysander, and bring the Count."
It was early morning, with February in its last days.
The visitor's iron shoes clanked sharply on the marble floor of the reception room, and the absence of everything like ornament in his equipment bespoke preparation for immediate hard service.
"I hope the Mother is keeping you well," she said, presenting her hand to him.
With a fervor somewhat more marked than common, he kissed the white offering, and awaited her bidding.
"My attendants are gone to the chapel, but I will hear you--or will you lend us your presence at the service, and have the audience afterwards?"
"I am in armor, and my steed is at the door, and my men biding at the Adrianople Gate; wherefore, fair Princess, if it be your pleasure, I will present my petition now."
In grave mistrust, she returned:

"God help us, Count!
I doubt you have something ill to relate.
Since the good Gregory fled into exile to escape his persecutors, but more especially since Cardinal Isidore attempted Latin mass in Sancta Sophia, and the madman Gennadius so frightened the people with his senseless anathemas, [Footnote: The scene here alluded to by the Princess Irene is doubtless the one so vividly described by Gibbon as having taken place in Sancta Sophia, the 12th of December, 1452, being the mass celebrated by Cardinal Isidore in an attempt to reconcile the Latin and Greek factions.
Enumerating the consequences of the same futile effort at compromise, Von Hammer says: "Instead of uniting for the common defence, the Greeks and Latins fled, leaving the churches empty; the priests refused the sacrament to the dying who were not of their faith; the monks and nuns repudiated confessors who acknowledged the _henoticon_ (decree ordaining the reunion of the two churches); a spirit of frenzy took possession of the convents; one _religieuse_, to the great scandal of all the faithful, adopted the faith and costume of the Mussulmans, eating meat and adoring the Prophet.
Thus Lent passed."
(Vol.
II., p.
397.)
To the same effect we read in the Universal History of the Catholic Church (Vol.
XXII., p. 103): "The religious who affected to surpass others in sanctity of life and purity of faith, following the advice of Gennadius and their spiritual advisers, as well as that of the preachers and laity of their party, condemned the decree of union, and anathematized those who approved or might approve it.
The common people, sallying from the monasteries, betook themselves to the taverns; there flourishing glasses of wine, they reviled all who had consented to the union, and drinking in honor of an image of the Mother of God, prayed her to protect and defend the city against Mahomet, as she had formerly defended it against Chosroes and the Kagan.
We will have nothing to do with assistance from the Latins or a union with them.
Far from us be the worship of the _azymites_."]
I have been beset with forebodings until I startle at my own thoughts.
It were gentle, did you go to your request at once."
She permitted him to lead her to an armless chair, and, standing before her, he spoke with decision:

"Princess Irene, now that you have resolved finally to remain in the city, and abide the issue of the siege, rightly judging it an affair determinable by God, it is but saying the truth as I see it, that no one is more interested in what betides us from day to day than you; for if Heaven frowns upon our efforts at defence, and there comes an assault, and we are taken, the Conqueror, by a cruel law of war, has at disposal the property both public and private he gains, and every living thing as well.
We who fight may die the death he pleases; you--alas, most noble and virtuous lady, my tongue refuses the words that rise to it for utterance!"
The rose tints in her cheeks faded, yet she answered: "I know what you would say, and confess it has appalled me.
Sometimes it tempts me to fly while yet I can; then I remember I am a Palaeologus.
I remember also my kinsman the Emperor is to be sustained in the trial confronting him.
I remember too the other women, high and low, who will stay and share the fortunes of their fighting husbands and brothers.
If I have less at stake than they, Count Corti, the demands of honor are more rigorous upon me."
The count's eyes glowed with admiration, but next moment the light in them went out.
"Noble lady," he began, "I hope it will not be judged too great a familiarity to say I have some days been troubled on your account.
I have feared you might be too confident of our ability to beat the enemy.
It seems my duty to warn you of the real outlook that you may permit us to provide for your safety while opportunities favor."
"For my flight, Count Corti?"
"Nay, Princess Irene, your retirement from the city."
She smiled at the distinction he made, but replied:

"I will hear you, Count."
"It is for you to consider, O Princess--if reports of the Sultan's preparation are true--this assault in one feature at least will be unparalleled.
The great guns for which he has been delaying are said to be larger than ever before used against walls.
They may destroy our defences at once; they may command all the space within those defences; they may search every hiding-place; the uncertainties they bring with them are not to be disregarded by the bravest soldier, much less the unresisting classes....
In the next place, I think it warrantable from the mass of rumors which has filled the month to believe the city will be assailed by a force much greater than was ever drawn together under her walls.
Suffer me to refer to them, O Princess...
The Sultan is yet at Adrianople assembling his army.
Large bodies of footmen are crossing the Hellespont at Gallipolis and the Bosphorus at Hissar; in the region of Adrianople the country is covered with hordes of horsemen speaking all known tongues and armed with every known weapon--Cossacks from the north, Arabs from the south, Koords and Tartars from the east, Roumanians and Slavs from beyond the Balkans.
The roads from the northwest are lined with trains bringing supplies and siege-machinery.
The cities along the shores of the Black Sea have yielded to Mahommed; those which defied him are in ruins.
An army is devastating Morea.
The brother whom His Majesty the Emperor installed ruler there is dead or a wanderer, no man can say in what parts.
Assistance cannot be expected from him.
Above us, far as the sea, the bays are crowded with ships of all classes; four hundred hostile sail have been counted from the hill-tops.
And now that there is no longer a hope of further aid from the Christians of Europe, the effect of the news upon our garrison is dispiriting.
Our garrison!
Alas, Princess, with the foreigners come to our aid, it is not sufficient to man the walls on the landward side alone."
"The picture is gloomy, Count, but if you have drawn it to shake my purpose, it is not enough.
I have put myself in the hands of the Blessed Mother.
I shall stay, and be done with as God orders."
Again the Count's face glowed with admiration.
"I thought as much, O Princess," he said warmly; "yet it seemed to me a duty to advise you of the odds against us; and now, the duty done, I pray you hear me as graciously upon another matter.... Last night, seeing the need of information of the enemy, I besought His Majesty to allow me to ride toward Adrianople.
He consented, and I set out immediately; but before going, before bidding you adieu, noble Princess and dear lady, I have a prayer to offer you."
He hesitated; then plucking courage from the embarrassment of silence, went on:

"Dear lady, your resolution to stay and face the dangers of the siege and assault fills me with alarm for your safety."
He cast himself upon his knees, and stretched his hands to her.
"Give me permission to protect you.
I devote my sword to you, and the skill of my hands--my life, my soul.
Let me be your knight."
She arose, but he continued:

"Some day, deeds done for your country and religion may give me courage to speak more boldly of what I feel and hope; but now I dare go no further than ask what you have just heard.
Let me be your protector and knight through the perils of the siege at least."
The Princess was pleased with the turn his speech had taken.
She thought rapidly.
A knight in battle, foremost in the press, her name a conquering cry on his lips were but the constituents of a right womanly ambition.
She answered:

"Count Corti, I accept thy offer."
Taking the hand she extended, he kissed it reverently, and said:

"I am happy above other men.
Now, O Princess, give me a favor--a glove, a scarf--something I may wear, to prove me thy knight."
She took from her neck a net of knitted silk, pinkish in hue, and large enough for a kerchief or waist sash.
"If I go about this gift," she said, her face deeply suffused, "in a way to provoke a smile hereafter; if in placing it around thy neck with my own hands"--with the words, she bent over him, and dropped the net outside the hood so the ends hung loosely down his breast--"I overstep any rule of modesty, I pray you will not misunderstand me.
I am thinking of my country, my kinsman, of religion and God, and the service even unto noble deeds thou mayst do them.
Rise, Count Corti.
In the ride before thee now, in the perils to come, thou shalt have my prayers."
The Count arose, but afraid to trust himself in further speech, he carried her hand to his lips again, and with a simple farewell, hurried out, and mounting his horse rode at speed for the Adrianople Gate.
Four days after, he reentered the gate, bringing a prisoner, and passing straight to the Very High Residence, made report to the Emperor, Justiniani and Duke Notaras in council.
"I have been greatly concerned for you, Count," said Constantine; "and not merely because a good sword can be poorly spared just now."
The imperial pleasure was unfeigned.
"Your Majesty's grace is full reward for my performance," the Count replied, and rising from the salutation, he began his recital.
"Stay," said the Emperor, "I will have a seat brought that you may be at ease."
Corti declined: "The Arabs have a saying, Your Majesty--'A nest for a setting bird, a saddle for a warrior.'
The jaunt has but rested me, and there was barely enough danger in it....
The Turk is an old acquaintance.
I have lived with him, and been his guest in house and tent, and as a comrade tempted Providence at his side under countless conditions, until I know his speech and usages, himself scarcely better.
My African Berbers are all Mohammedans who have performed the Pilgrimage.
One of them is a muezzin by profession; and if he can but catch sight of the sun, he will never miss the five hours of prayer.
None of them requires telling the direction to Mecca....
I issued from Your Majesty's great gate about the third hour, and taking the road to Adrianople, journeyed till near midday before meeting a human being.
There were farms and farmhouses on my right and left, and the fields had been planted in good season; but the growing grain was wasted; and when I sought the houses to have speech with their tenants they were forsaken.
Twice we were driven off by the stench of bodies rotting before the doors."
"Greeks?"
"Greeks, Your Majesty....
There were wild hogs in the thickets which fled at sight of us, and vultures devouring the corpses."
"Were there no other animals, no horses or oxen?"
asked Justiniani.
"None, noble Genoese--none seen by us, and the swine were spared, I apprehend, because their meat is prohibited to the children of Islam.... At length Hadifah, whom I have raised to be a Sheik--Your Majesty permitting--and whose eyes discover the small things with which space is crowded as he were a falcon making circles up near the sun--Hadifah saw a man in the reeds hiding; and we pursued the wretch, and caught him, and he too was a Greek; and when his fright allowed him to talk, he told us a band of strange people, the like of whom he had never seen, attacked his hut, burned it, carried off his goats and she buffaloes; and since that hour, five weeks gone, he had been hunting for his wife and three girl-children.
God be merciful to them!
Of the Turks he could tell nothing except that now, everything of value gone, they too had disappeared.
I gave the poor man a measure of oaten cakes, and left him to his misery.
God be merciful to him also!"
"Did you not advise him to come to me?"
"Your Majesty, he was a husband and father seeking his family; with all humility, what else is there for him to do?"
"I give your judgment credit, Count.
There is nothing else."
"I rode on till night, meeting nobody, friend or foe--on through a wide district, lately inhabited, now a wilderness.
The creatures of the Sultan had passed through it, and there was fire in their breath.
We discovered a dried-up stream, and by sinking in its bed obtained water for our horses.
There, in a hollow, we spent the night.... Next morning, after an hour's ride, we met a train of carts drawn by oxen.
The groaning and creaking of the distraught wheels warned me of the encounter before the advance guard of mounted men, quite a thousand strong, were in view.
I did not draw rein"--

"What!"
cried Justiniani, astonished.
"With but a company of nine?"
The Count smiled.
"I crave your pardon, gallant Captain.
In my camp the night before, I prepared my Berbers for the meeting."
"By the bones of the saints, Count Corti, thou dost confuse me the more!
With such odds against thee, what preparations were at thy command?"
"'There was never amulet like a grain of wit in a purse under thy cap.'
Good Captain, the saying is not worse of having proceeded from a Persian.
I told my followers we were likely at any moment to be overtaken by a force too strong for us to fight; but instead of running away, we must meet them heartily, as friends enlisted in the same cause; and if they asked whence we were, we must be sure of agreement in our reply.
I was to be a Turk; they, Egyptians from west of the Nile.
We had come in by the new fortress opposite the White Castle, and were going to the mighty Lord Mahommed in Adrianople.
Beyond that, I bade them be silent, leaving the entertainment of words to me."
The Emperor and Justiniani laughed, but Notaras asked: "If thy Berbers are Mohammedans, as thou sayest, Count Corti, how canst thou rely on them against Mohammedans?"
"My Lord the High Admiral may not have heard of the law by which, if one Arab kills another, the relatives of the dead man are bound to kill him, unless there be composition.
So I had merely to remind Hadifah and his companions of the Turks we slew in the field near Basch-Kegan."
Corti continued: "After parley with the captain of the advance guard, I was allowed to ride on; and coming to the train, I found the carts freighted with military engines and tools for digging trenches and fortifying camps.
There were hundreds of them, and the drivers were a multitude.
Indeed, Your Majesty, from head to foot the caravan was miles in reach, its flanks well guarded by groups of horsemen at convenient intervals."
This statement excited the three counsellors.
"After passing the train," the Count was at length permitted to resume, "my way was through bodies of troops continuously--all irregulars.
It must have been about three o'clock in the afternoon when I came upon the most surprising sight.
Much I doubt if ever the noble Captain Justiniani, with all his experience, can recall anything like it.
"First there was a great company of pioneers with tools for grading the hills and levelling the road; then on a four-wheeled carriage two men stood beating a drum; their sticks looked like the enlarged end of a galley oar.
The drum responded to their blows in rumbles like dull thunder from distant clouds.
While I sat wondering why they beat it, there came up next sixty oxen yoked in pairs.
Your Majesty can in fancy measure the space they covered.
On the right and left of each yoke strode drivers with sharpened goads, and their yelling harmonized curiously with the thunder of the drum.
The straining of the brutes was pitiful to behold.
And while I wondered yet more, a log of bronze was drawn toward me big at one end as the trunk of a great plane tree, and so long that thirty carts chained together as one wagon, were required to support it laid lengthwise; and to steady the piece on its rolling bed, two hundred and fifty stout laborers kept pace with it unremittingly watchful.
The movement was tedious, but at last I saw"--

"A cannon!"
exclaimed the Genoese.
"Yes, noble Captain, the gun said to be the largest ever cast."
"Didst thou see any of the balls?"
"Other carts followed directly loaded with gray limestones chiselled round; and to my inquiry what the stones were for, I was told they were bullets twelve spans in circumference, and that the charge of powder used would cast them a mile."
The inquisitors gazed at each other mutely, and their thoughts may be gathered from the action of the Emperor.
He touched a bell on a table, and to Phranza, who answered the call, he said: "Lord Chamberlain, have two men well skilled in the construction of walls report to me in the morning.
There is work for them which they must set about at once.
I will furnish the money."
[Footnote: Before the siege by the Turks, two monks, Manuel Giagari and Neophytus of Rhodes, were charged with repairing the walls, but they buried the sums intrusted to them for these works; and in the pillage of the city seventy thousand pieces of gold thus advanced by the Emperor were unearthed.--VON HAMMER, Vol.
II., p.
417.]
"I have but little more of importance to engage Your Majesty's attention....
Behind the monster cannon, two others somewhat smaller were brought up in the same careful manner.
I counted seventeen pieces all brass, the least of them exceeding in workmanship and power the best in the Hippodrome."
"Were there more?"
Justiniani asked.
"Many more, brave Captain, but ancient, and unworthy mention....
The day was done when, by sharp riding, I gained the rear of the train.
At sunrise on the third day, I set out in return....
I have a prisoner whom this august council may examine with profit.
He will, at least, confirm my report."
"Who is he?"
"The captain of the advance guard."
"How came you by him?"
"Your Majesty, I induced him to ride a little way with me, and at a convenient time gave his bridle rein to Hadifah.
In his boyhood the Sheik was trained to leading camels, and he assures me it is much easier to lead a horse."
The sally served to lighten the sombre character of the Count's report, and in the midst of the merriment, he was dismissed.
The prisoner was then brought in, and put to question; next day the final preparation for the reception of Mahommed was begun.
With a care equal to the importance of the business, Constantine divided the walls into sections, beginning on the landward side of the Golden Gate or Seven Towers, and ending at the Cynegion.
Of the harbor front he made one division, with the Grand Gate of Blacherne and the Acropolis or Point Serail for termini; from Point Serail to the Seven Towers he stationed patrols and lookouts, thinking the sea and rocks sufficient to discourage assault in that quarter.
His next care was the designation of commandants of the several divisions.
The individuals thus honored have been already mentioned; though it may be well to add how the Papal Legate, Cardinal Isidore, doffing his frock and donning armor, voluntarily accepted chief direction along the harbor--an example of martial gallantry which ought to have shamed the lukewarm Greeks morosely skulking in their cells.
Shrewdly anticipating a concentration of effort against the Gate St. Romain, and its two auxiliary towers, Bagdad and St. Romain, the former on the right hand and the latter on the left, he assigned Justiniani to its defence.
Upon the walls, and in the towers numerously garnishing them, the gallant Emperor next brought up his guns and machines, with profuse supplies of missiles.
Then, after flooding the immense ditch, he held a review in the Hippodrome, whence the several detachments marched to their stations.
Riding with his captains, and viewing the walls, now gay with banners and warlike tricking, Constantine took heart, and told how Amurath, the peerless warrior, had dashed his Janissaries against them, and rued the day.
"Is this boy Mahommed greater than his father?"
he asked.
"God knows," Isidore responded, crossing himself breast and forehead.
And well content, the cavalcade repassed the ponderous Gate St. Romain.
All that could be done had been done.
There was nothing more but to wait.
CHAPTER VI

MAHOMMED AT THE GATE ST. ROMAIN

In the city April seemed to have borrowed from the delays of Mahommed; never month so slow in coming.
At last, however, its first day, dulled by a sky all clouds, and with winds from the Balkans.
The inertness of the young Sultan was not from want of will or zeal.
It took two months to drag his guns from Adrianople; but with them the army moved, and as it moved it took possession, or rather covered the land.
At length, he too arrived, bringing, as it were, the month with him; and then he lost no more time.
About five miles from the walls on the south or landward side, he drew his hordes together in the likeness of a line of battle, and at a trumpet call they advanced in three bodies simultaneously.
So a tidal wave, far extending, broken, noisy, terrible, rises out of the deep, and rolls upon a shore of stony cliffs.
Near ten o'clock in the forenoon of the sixth of April the Emperor mounted the roof of the tower of St. Romain, mentioned as at the left of the gate bearing the same name.
There were with him Justiniani, the Cardinal Isidore, John Grant, Phranza, Theophilus Palaeologus, Duke Notaras, and a number of inferior persons native and foreign.
He had come to see all there was to be seen of the Turks going into position.
The day was spring-like, with just enough breeze to blow the mists away.
The reader must think of the roof as an immense platform accessible by means of a wooden stairway in the interior of the tower, and battlemented on the four sides, the merlons of stone in massive blocks, and of a height to protect a tall man, the embrasures requiring banquettes to make them serviceable.
In arrangement somewhat like a ship's battery, there are stoutly framed arbalists and mangonels on the platform, and behind them, with convenient spaces between, arquebuses on tripods, cumbrous catapults, and small cannon on high axles ready for wheeling into position between the merlons.
Near each machine its munitions lie in order.
Leaning against the walls there are also spears, javelins, and long and cross bows; while over the corner next the gate floats an imperial standard, its white field emblazoned with the immemorial Greek cross in gold.
The defenders of the tower are present; and as they are mostly Byzantines, their attitudes betray much more than cold military respect, for they are receiving the Emperor, whom they have been taught to regard worshipfully.
They study him, and take not a little pride in observing that, clad in steel cap-a-pie, he in no wise suffers by comparison with the best of his attendants, not excepting Justiniani, the renowned Genoese captain.
Not more to see than be seen, the visor of his helmet is raised; and stealing furtive glances at his countenance, noble by nature, but just now more than ordinarily inspiring, they are better and stronger for what they read in it.
On the right and left the nearest towers obstruct the view of the walls in prolongation; but southward the country spreads before the party a campania rolling and fertile, dotted with trees scattered and in thin groves, and here and there an abandoned house.
The tender green of vegetation upon the slopes reminds those long familiar with them that grass is already invading what were lately gardens and cultivated fields.
Constantine makes the survey in silence, for he knows how soon even the grass must disappear.
Just beyond the flooded ditch at the foot of the first or outward wall is a road, and next beyond the road a cemetery crowded with tombs and tombstones, and brown and white mausolean edifices; indeed, the chronicles run not back to a time when that marginal space was unallotted to the dead.
From the far skyline the eyes of the fated Emperor drop to the cemetery, and linger there.
Presently one of his suite calls out: "Hark!
What sound is that?"
They all give attention.
"It is thunder."
"No--thunder rolls.
This is a beat."
Constantine and Justiniani remembered Count Corti's description of the great drum hauled before the artillery train of the Turks, and the former said calmly:

"They are coming."
Almost as he spoke the sunlight mildly tinting the land in the farness seemed to be troubled, and on the tops of the remote hillocks there appeared to be giants rolling them up, as children roll snow-balls--and the movement was toward the city.
The drum ceased not its beating or coming.
Justiniani by virtue of his greater experience, was at length able to say:

"Your Majesty, it is here in front of us; and as this Gate St. Romain marks the centre of your defences, so that drum marks the centre of an advancing line, and regulates the movement from wing to wing."
"It must be so, Captain; for see--there to the left--those are bodies of men."
"And now, Your Majesty, I hear trumpets."
A little later some one cried out:

"Now I hear shouting."
And another: "I see gleams of metal."
Ere long footmen and horsemen were in view, and the Byzantines, brought to the wall by thousands, gazed and listened in nervous wonder; for look where they might over the campania, they saw the enemy closing in upon them, and heard his shouting, and the neighing of horses, the blaring of horns, and the palpitant beating of drums.
"By our Lady of Blacherne," said the Emperor, after a long study of the spectacle, "it is a great multitude, reaching to the sea here on our left, and, from the noise, to the Golden Horn on our right; none the less I am disappointed.
I imagined much splendor of harness and shields and banners, but see only blackness and dust.
I cannot make out amongst them one Sultanic flag.
Tell me, most worthy John Grant--it being reported that thou hast great experience combating with and against these hordes--tell me if this poverty of appearance is usual with them."
The sturdy German, in a jargon difficult to follow, answered: "These at our left are the scum of Asia.
They are here because they have nothing; their hope is to better their condition, to return rich, to exchange ragged turbans for crowns, and goatskin jackets for robes of silk.
Look, Your Majesty, the tombs in front of us are well kept; to-morrow if there be one left standing, it will have been rifled.
Of the lately buried there will not be a ring on a finger or a coin under a tongue.
Oh, yes, the ghouls will look better next week!
Only give them time to convert the clothes they will strip from the dead into fresh turbans.
But when the Janissaries come Your Majesty will not be disappointed.
See--their advance guard now--there on the rising ground in front of the gate."
There was a swell of ground to the right of the gate rather than in front of it, and as the party looked thither, a company of horsemen were seen riding slowly but in excellent order, and the sheen of their arms and armor silvered the air about them.
Immediately other companies deployed on the right and left of the first one; then the thunderous drum ceased; whereat, from the hordes out on the campania, brought to a sudden standstill, detachments dashed forward at full speed, and dismounting, began digging a trench.
"Be this Sultan like or unlike his father, he is a soldier.
He means to cover his army, and at the same time enclose us from sea to harbor.
To-morrow, my Lord, only high-flying hawks can communicate with us from the outside."
This, from Justiniani to the Emperor, was scarcely noticed, for behind the deploying Janissaries, there arose an outburst of music in deep volume, the combination of clarions and cymbals so delightful to warriors of the East; at the same instant a yellow flag was displayed.
Then old John Grant exclaimed:

"The colors of the _Silihdars!_ Mahommed is not far away.
Nay, Your Majesty, look--the Sultan himself!"
Through an interval of the guard, a man in chain mail shooting golden sparkles, helmed, and with spear in hand and shield at his back, trotted forth, his steed covered with flowing cloths.
Behind him appeared a suite mixed of soldiers and civilians, the former in warlike panoply, the latter in robes and enormous turbans.
Down the slope the foremost rider led as if to knock at the gate.
On the tower the cannon were loaded, and run into the embrasures.
"Mahommed, saidst thou, John Grant?"
"Mahommed, Your Majesty."
"Then I call him rash; but as we are not ashamed of our gates and walls, let him have his look in peace....
Hear you, men, let him look, and go in peace."
The repetition was in restraint of the eager gunners.
Further remark was cut short by a trumpet sounded at the foot of the tower.
An officer peered over the wall, and reported: "Your Majesty, a knight just issued from the gate is riding forth.
I take him to be the Italian, Count Corti."
Constantine became a spectator of what ensued.
Ordinarily the roadway from the country was carried over the deep moat in front of the Gate St. Romain by a floor of stout timbers well balustraded at the sides, and resting on brick piers.
Of the bridge nothing now remained but a few loose planks side by side ready to be hastily snatched from their places.
To pass them afoot was a venture; yet Count Corti, when the Emperor looked at him from the height, was making the crossing mounted, and blowing a trumpet as he went.
"Is the man mad?"
asked the Emperor, in deep concern.
"Mad?
No, he is challenging the Mahounds to single combat; and, my lords and gentlemen, if he be skilful as he is bold, then, by the Three Kings of Cologne, we will see some pretty work in pattern for the rest of us."
Thus Grant replied.
Corti made the passage safely, and in the road beyond the moat halted, and drove the staff of his banderole firmly in the ground.
A broad opening through the cemetery permitted him to see and be seen by the Turks, scarcely a hundred yards away.
Standing in his stirrups, he sounded the trumpet again--a clear call ringing with defiance.
Mahommed gave over studying the tower and deep-sunken gate, and presently beckoned to his suite.
"What is the device on yon pennon?"
he asked.
"A moon with a cross on its face."
"Say you so?"
Twice the defiance was repeated, and so long the young Sultan, sat still, his countenance unusually grave.
He recognized the Count; only he thought of him by the dearer Oriental name, Mirza.
He knew also how much more than common ambition there was in the blatant challenge--that it was a reminder of the treaty between them, and, truly interpreted, said, in effect: "Lo, my Lord!
she is well, and for fear thou judge me unworthy of her, send thy bravest to try me."
And he hesitated--an accident might quench the high soul.
Alas, then, for the Princess Irene in the day of final assault!
Who would deliver her to him?
The hordes, and the machinery, all the mighty preparation, were, in fact, less for conquest and glory than love.
Sore the test had there been one in authority to say to him: "She is thine, Lord Mahommed; thine, so thou take her, and leave the city."
A third time the challenge was delivered, and from the walls a taunting cheer descended.
Then the son of Isfendiar, recognizing the banderole, and not yet done with chafing over his former defeat, pushed through the throng about Mahommed, and prayed:

"O my Lord, suffer me to punish yon braggart."
Mahommed replied: "Thou hast felt his hand already, but go--I commend thee to thy houris."
He settled in his saddle smiling.
The danger was not to the Count.
The arms, armor, weapons, and horse-furniture of the Moslem were identical with the Italian's; and it being for the challenged party to determine with what the duel should be fought, whether with axe, sword, lance or bow, the son of Isfendiar chose the latter, and made ready while advancing.
The Count was not slow in imitating him.
Each held his weapon--short for saddle service--in the left hand, the arrow in place, and the shield on the left forearm.
No sooner had they reached the open ground in the cemetery than they commenced moving in circles, careful to keep the enemy on the shield side at a distance of probably twenty paces.
The spectators became silent.
Besides the skill which masters in such affrays should possess, they were looking for portents of the result.
Three times the foemen encircled each other with shield guard so well kept that neither saw an opening to attack; then the Turk discharged his arrow, intending to lodge it in the shoulder of the other's horse, the buckling attachments of the neck mail being always more or less imperfect.
The Count interposed his shield, and shouted in Osmanli: "Out on thee, son of Isfendiar!
I am thy antagonist, not my horse.
Thou shalt pay for the cowardice."
He then narrowed the circle of his movement, and spurring full speed, compelled the Turk to turn on a pivot so reduced it was almost a halt.
The exposure while taking a second shaft from the quiver behind the right shoulder was dangerously increased.
"Beware!"
the Count cried again, launching his arrow through the face opening of the hood.
The son of Isfendiar might never attain his father's Pachalik.
There was not voice left him for a groan.
He reeled in his saddle, clutching the empty air, then tumbled to the earth.
The property of the dead man, his steed, arms, and armor, were lawful spoils; but without heeding them, the Count retired to his banderole, and, amidst the shouts of the Greeks on the walls and towers, renewed the challenge.
A score of chiefs beset the Sultan for permission to engage the insolent _Gabour_.
To an Arab Sheik, loudest in importunity, he said: "What has happened since yesterday to dissatisfy thee with life?"
The Sheik raised a lance with a flexible shaft twenty feet in length, made of a cane peculiar to the valley of the Jordan, and shaking it stoutly, replied:

"Allah, and the honor of my tribe!"
Perceiving the man's reliance in his weapon, Mahommed returned: "How many times didst thou pray yesterday?"
"Five times, my Lord."
"And to-day?"
"Twice."
"Go, then; but as yon champion hath not a lance to put him on equality with thee, he will be justified in taking to the sword."
The Sheik's steed was of the most precious strain of El-Hejaz; and sitting high in the saddle, a turban of many folds on his head, a striped robe drawn close to the waist, his face thin, coffee-colored, hawk-nosed, and lightning-eyed, he looked a king of the desert.
Galloping down on the Christian, he twirled the formidable lance dextrously, until it seemed not more than a stalk of dried papyrus.
The Count beheld in the performance a trick of the _djerid_ he had often practised with Mahommed.
Uncertain if the man's robe covered armor, he met him with an arrow, and seeing it fall off harmless, tossed the bow on his back, drew sword, and put his horse in forward movement, caracoling right and left to disturb the enemy's aim.
Nothing could be more graceful than this action.
Suddenly the Sheik stopped playing, and balancing the lance overhead, point to the foe, rushed with a shrill cry upon him.
Corti's friends on the tower held their breath; even the Emperor said: "It is too unequal.
God help him!"
At the last moment, however--the moment of the thrust--changing his horse to the right, the Count laid himself flat upon its side, under cover of his shield.
The thrust, only a little less quick, passed him in the air, and before the Sheik could recover or shorten his weapon, the trained foeman was within its sweep.
In a word, the Arab was at mercy.
Riding with him side by side, hand on his shoulder, the Count shouted: "Yield thee!"
"Dog of a Christian, never!
Do thy worst."
The sword twirled once--a flash--then it descended, severing the lance in front of the owner's grip.
The fragment fell to the earth.
"Now yield thee!"
The Sheik drew rein.
"Why dost thou not kill me?"
"I have a message for thy master yonder, the Lord Mahommed."
"Speak it then."
"Tell him he is in range of the cannon on the towers, and only the Emperor's presence there restrains the gunners.
There is much need for thee to haste."
"Who art thou?"
"I am an Italian knight who, though thy Lord's enemy, hath reason to love him.
Wilt thou go?"
"I will do as thou sayest."
"Alight, then.
Thy horse is mine."
"For ransom?"
"No."
The Sheik dismounted grumblingly, and was walking off when the cheering of the Greeks stung him to the soul.
"A chance--O Christian, another chance--to-day--to-morrow!"
"Deliver the message; it shall be as thy Lord may then appoint.
Bestir thyself."
The Count led the prize to the banderole, and flinging the reins over it, faced the gleaming line of Janissaries once more, trumpet at mouth.
He saw the Sheik salute Mahommed; then the attendants closed around them.
"A courteous dog, by the Prophet!"
said the Sultan.
"In what tongue did he speak?"
"My Lord, he might have been bred under my own tent."
The Sultan's countenance changed.
"Was there not more of his message?"
He was thinking of the Princess Irene.
"Yes, my Lord."
"Repeat it."
"He will fight me again to-day or to-morrow, as my Lord may appoint--and I want my horse.
Without him, El-Hejaz will be a widow."
A red spot appeared on Mahommed's forehead.
"Begone!"
he cried angrily.
"Seest thou not, O fool, that when we take the city we will recover thy horse?
Fight thou shalt not, for in that day I shall have need of thee."
Thereupon he bade them open for him, and rode slowly back up the eminence, and when he disappeared Corti was vainly sounding his trumpet.
The two horses were led across the dismantled bridge, and into the gate.
"Heaven hath sent me a good soldier," said the Emperor to the Count, upon descending from the tower.
Then Justiniani asked: "Why didst thou spare thy last antagonist?"
Corti answered truthfully.
"It was well done," the Genoese returned, offering his hand.
"Ay," said Constantine, cordially, "well done.
But mount now, and ride with us."
"Your Majesty, a favor first.... A man is in the road dead.
Let his body be placed on a bier, and carried to his friends."
"A most Christian request!
My Lord Chamberlain, attend to it."
The cavalcade betook itself then to other parts, the better to see the disposition of the Turks; and everywhere on the landward side it was the same--troops in masses, and intrenchments in progress.
Closing the inspection at set of sun, the Emperor beheld the sea and the Bosphorus in front of the Golden Horn covered with hundreds of sails.
"The leaguer is perfected," said the Genoese.
"And the issue with God," Constantine replied.
"Let us to Hagia St.
Sophia."
CHAPTER VII

THE GREAT GUN SPEAKS

The first sufficient gleam of light next morning revealed to the watchmen on the towers an ominous spectacle.
Through the night they had heard a medley of noises peculiar to a multitude at work with all their might; now, just out of range of their own guns, they beheld a continuous rampart of fresh earth grotesquely spotted with marbles from the cemetery.
In no previous siege of the Byzantine capital was there reference to such a preliminary step.
To the newly enlisted, viewing for the first time an enemy bodily present, it seemed like the world being pared down to the smallest dimensions; while their associate veterans, to whom they naturally turned for comfort, admitted an appreciable respect for the Sultan.
Either he had a wise adviser, they said, or he was himself a genius.
Noon--and still the workmen seemed inexhaustible--still the rampart grew in height--still the hordes out on the campania multiplied, and the horizon line west of the Gate St. Romain was lost in the increasing smoke of a vast bivouac.
Nightfall--and still the labor.
About midnight, judging by the sounds, the sentinels fancied the enemy approached nearer the walls; and they were not mistaken.
With the advent of the second morning, here and there at intervals, ill-defined mounds of earth were seen so much in advance of the intrenched line that, by a general order, a fire of stones and darts was opened upon them; and straightway bodies of bowmen and slingers rushed forward, and returned the fire, seeking to cover the mound builders.
This was battle.
Noon again--and battle.
In the evening--battle.
The advantage of course was with the besieged.
The work on the mounds meanwhile continued, while the campania behind the intrenchment was alive with a creaking of wheels burdened by machinery, and a shouting of ox-drivers; and the veterans on the walls said the enemy was bringing up his balistas and mangonels.
The third morning showed the mounds finished, and crowned with mantelets, behind which, in working order and well manned, every sort of engine known in sieges from Alexander to the Crusaders was in operation.
Thenceforward, it is to be observed, the battle was by no means one-sided.
In this opening there was no heat or furore of combat; it was rather the action of novices trying their machines, or, in modern artillery parlance, finding the range.
Many minutes often intervened between shots, and as the preliminary object on the part of the besiegers was to destroy the merlons sheltering the warders, did a stone strike either wall near the top, the crash was saluted by cheers.
Now the foreigners defending were professionals who had graduated in all the arts of town and castle taking.
These met the successes of their antagonists with derision.
"Apprentices," they would say, "nothing but apprentices."...
"See those fellows by the big springal there turning the winch the wrong way!"
... "The turbaned sons of Satan!
Have they no eyes?
I'll give them a lesson.
Look!"
And if the bolt fell truly, there was loud laughter on the walls.
The captains, moreover, were incessantly encouraging the raw men under them.
"Two walls, and a hundred feet of flooded ditch!
There will be merry Christmas in the next century before the Mahounds get to us at the rate they are coming.
Shoot leisurely, men--leisurely.
An infidel for every bolt!"
Now on the outer wall, which was the lower of the two, and naturally first to draw the enemy's ire, and then along the inner, the Emperor went, indifferent to danger or fatigue, and always with words of cheer.
"The stones under our feet are honest," he would say.
"The Persian came thinking to batter them down, but after many days he fled; and search as we will, no man can lay a finger on the face of one of them, and say, 'Here Chosroes left a scar.'
So Amurath, sometimes called Murad, this young man's father, wasted months, and the souls of his subjects without count; but when he fled not a coping block had been disturbed in its bed.
What has been will be again.
God is with us."
When the three days were spent, the Greeks under arms began to be accustomed to the usage, and make merry of it, like the veterans.
The fourth day about noon the Emperor, returning from a round of the walls, ascended the Bagdad tower mentioned as overlooking the Gate St. Romain on the right hand; and finding Justiniani on the roof, he said to him: "This fighting, if it may be so called, Captain, is without heart.
But two of our people have been killed; not a stone is shaken.
To me it seems the Sultan is amusing us while preparing something more serious."
"Your Majesty," the Genoese returned, soberly, "now has Heaven given you the spirit of a soldier and the eyes as well.
Old John Grant told me within an hour that the yellow flag on the rising ground before us denotes the Sultan's quarters in the field, and is not to be confounded with his battle flag.
It follows, I think, could we get behind the Janissaries dismounted on the further slope of the rise, yet in position to meet a sally, we would discover the royal tent not unwisely pitched, if, as I surmise, this gate is indeed his point of main attack.
And besides here are none of the old-time machines as elsewhere along our front; not a catapult, or bricole, or bible--as some, with wicked facetiousness, have named a certain invention for casting huge stones; nor have we yet heard the report of a cannon, or arquebus, or bombard, although we know the enemy has them in numbers.
Wherefore, keeping in mind the circumstance of his presence here, the omissions satisfy me the Sultan relies on his great guns, and that, while amusing us, as Your Majesty has said, he is mounting them.
To-morrow, or perhaps next day, he will open with them, and then"--

"What then?"
Constantine asked.
"The world will have a new lesson in warfare."
The Emperor's countenance, visible under his raised visor, knit hard.
"Dear, dear God!"
he said, half to himself.
"If this old Christian empire should be lost through folly of mine, who will there be to forgive me if not Thou?"
Then, seeing the Genoese observing him with surprise, he continued:

"It is a simple tale, Captain.... A Dacian, calling himself Urban, asked audience of me one day, and being admitted, said he was an artificer of cannon; that he had plied his art in the foundries of Germany, and from study of powder was convinced of the practicality of applying it to guns of heavier calibre than any in use.
He had discovered a composition of metals, he said, which was his secret, and capable, when properly cast, of an immeasurable strain.
Would I furnish him the materials, and a place, with appliances for the work such as he would name, I might collect the machines in my arsenal, and burn them or throw them into the sea.
I might even level my walls, and in their stead throw up ramparts of common earth, and by mounting his guns upon them secure my capital against the combined powers of the world.
He refused to give me details of his processes.
I asked him what reward he wanted, and he set it so high I laughed.
Thinking to sound him further, I kept him in my service a few days; but becoming weary of his importunities, I dismissed him.
I next heard of him at Adrianople.
The Sultan Mahommed entertained his propositions, built him a foundry, and tried one of his guns, with results the fame of which is a wonder to the whole East.
It was the log of bronze Count Corti saw on the road--now it is here--and Heaven sent it to me first."
"Your Majesty," returned the Genoese, impressed by the circumstance, and the evident remorse of the Emperor, "Heaven does not hold us accountable for errors of judgment.
There is not a monarch in Europe who would have accepted the man's terms, and it remains to be seen if Mahommed, as yet but a callow youth, has not been cheated.
But look yonder!"
As he spoke, the Janissaries in front of the gate mounted and rode forward, probably a hundred yards, pursued by a riotous shouting and cracking of whips.
Presently a train of buffaloes, yoked and tugging laboriously at something almost too heavy for them, appeared on the swell of earth; and there was a driver for every yoke, and every driver whirled a long stick with a longer lash fixed to it, and howled lustily.
"It is the great gun," said Constantine.
"They are putting it in position."
Justiniani spoke to the men standing by the machines: "Make ready bolt and stone."
The balistiers took to their wheels eagerly, and discharged a shower of missiles at the Janissaries and ox-drivers.
"Too short, my men--more range."
The elevation was increased; still the bolts fell short.
"Bring forward the guns!"
shouted Justiniani.
The guns were small bell-mouthed barrels of hooped iron, muzzle loading, mounted on high wheels, and each shooting half a dozen balls of lead large as walnuts.
They were carefully aimed.
The shot whistled and sang viciously.
"Higher, men!"
shouted the Genoese, from a merlon.
"Give the pieces their utmost range."
The Janissaries replied with a yell.
The second volley also failed.
Then Justiniani descended from his perch.
"Your Majesty," he said, "to stop the planting of the gun there is nothing for us but a sally."
"We are few, they are many," was the thoughtful reply.
"One of us on the wall is worth a score of them in the field.
Their gun is an experiment.
Let them try it first."
The Genoese replied: "Your Majesty is right."
The Turks toiled on, backing and shifting their belabored trains, until the monster at last threatened the city with its great black Cyclopean eye.
"The Dacian is not a bad engineer," said the Emperor.
"See, he is planting other pieces."
Thus Justiniani; for oxen in trains similar to the first one came up tugging mightily, until by mid-afternoon on each flank of the first monster three other glistening yellow logs lay on their carriages in a like dubious quiet, leaving no doubt that St. Romain was to be overwhelmed, if the new agencies answered expectations.
If there was anxiety here, over the way there was impatience too fierce for control.
Urban, the Dacian, in superintendency of the preparation, was naturally disposed to be careful, so much, in his view, depended on the right placement of the guns; but Mahommed, on foot, and whip in hand, was intolerant, and, not scrupling to mix with the workmen, urged them vehemently, now with threats, now with promises of reward.
"Thy beasts are snails!
Give me the goad," he cried, snatching one from a driver.
Then to Urban: "Bring the powder, and a bullet, for when the sun goes down thou shalt fire the great gun.
Demur not.
By the sword of Solomon, there shall be no sleep this night in yon _Gabour_ city, least of all in the palace they call Blacherne."
The Dacian brought his experts together.
The powder in a bag was rammed home; with the help of a stout slab, a stone ball was next rolled into the muzzle, then pushed nakedly down on the bag.
Of a truth there was need of measureless strength in the composition of the piece.
Finally the vent was primed, and a slow-match applied, after which Urban reported:

"The gun is ready, my Lord."
"Then watch the sun, and--_Bismillah!_--at its going down, fire....
Aim at the gate--this one before us--and if thou hit it or a tower on either hand, I will make thee a _begler-bey_."
The gun-planting continued.
Finally the sun paused in cloudy splendor ready to carry the day down with it.
The Sultan, from his tent of many annexes Bedouin fashion, walked to where Urban and his assistants stood by the carriage of the larger piece.
"Fire!"
he said.
Urban knelt before him.
"Will my Lord please retire?"
"Why should I retire?"
"There is danger."
Mahommed smiled haughtily.
"Is the piece trained on the gate?"
"It is; but I pray"--

"Now if thou wilt not have me believe thee a dog not less than an unbeliever, rise, and do my bidding."
The Dacian, without more ado, put the loose end of the slow-match into a pot of live coals near by, and when it began to spit and sputter, he cast it off.
His experts fled.
Only Mahommed remained with him; and no feat of daring in battle could have won the young Padishah a name for courage comparable to that the thousands looking on from a safe distance now gave him.
"Will my Lord walk with me a little aside?
He can then see the ball going."
Mahommed accepted the suggestion.
"Look now in a line with the gate, my Lord."
The match was at last spent.
A flash at the vent--a spreading white cloud--a rending of the air--the rattle of wheels obedient to the recoil of the gun--a sound thunder in volume, but with a crackle sharper than any thunder--and we may almost say that, with a new voice, and an additional terror, war underwent a second birth.
Mahommed's ears endured a wrench, and for a time he heard nothing; but he was too intent following the flight of the ball to mind whether the report of the gun died on the heights of Galata or across the Bosphorus at Scutari.
He saw the blackened sphere pass between the towers flanking the gate, and speed on into the city--how far, or with what effect, he could not tell, nor did he care.
Urban fell on his knees.
"Mercy, my Lord, mercy!"
"For what?
That thou didst not hit the gate?
Rise, man, and see if the gun is safe."
And when it was so reported, he called to Kalil, the Vizier, now come up: "Give the man a purse, and not a lean one, for, by Allah!
he is bringing Constantinople to me."
And despite the ringing in his ears, he went to his tent confident and happy.
On the tower meantime Constantine and the Genoese beheld the smoke leap forth and curtain the gun, and right afterward they heard the huge ball go tearing past them, like an invisible meteor.
Their eyes pursued the sound--where the missile fell they could not say--they heard a crash, as if a house midway the city had been struck--then they gazed at each other, and crossed themselves.
"There is nothing for us now but the sally," said the Emperor.
"Nothing," replied Justiniani.
"We must disable the guns."
"Let us go and arrange it."
There being no indication of further firing, the two descended from the tower.
The plan of sortie agreed upon was not without ingenuity.
The gate under the palace of Blacherne called _Cercoporta_ was to be opened in the night.
[Footnote: In the basement of the palace of Blacherne there was an underground exit, Cercoporta or gate of the Circus; but Isaac Comnenus had walled it up in order to avoid the accomplishment of a prediction which announced that the Emperor Frederick would enter Constantinople through it....
But before the siege by Mahommed the exit was restored, and it was through it the Turks passed into the city.--VON HAMMER, _Hist.
de l'Empire Ottoman._] Count Corti, with the body-guard mounted, was to pass out by it, and surprise the Janissaries defending the battery.
Simultaneously Justiniani should sally by the Gate St. Romain, cross the moat temporarily bridged for the purpose, and, with the footmen composing the force in reserve, throw himself upon the guns.
The scheme was faithfully attempted.
The Count, stealing out of the ancient exit in the uncertain light preceding the dawn, gained a position unobserved, and charged the careless Turks.
By this time it had become a general report that the net about his neck was a favor of the Princess Irene, and his battle cry confirmed it--_For God and Irene!_ Bursting through the half-formed opposition, he passed to the rear of the guns, and planted his banderole at the door of Mahommed's tent.
Had his men held together, he might have returned with a royal prisoner.
While attention was thus wholly given the Count, Justiniani overthrew the guns by demolishing the carriages.
A better acquaintance with the operation known to moderns as "spiking a piece," would have enabled him to make the blow irreparable.
The loss of Janissaries was severe; that of the besieged trifling.
The latter, foot and horse, returned by the Gate St. Romain unpursued.
Mahommed, aroused by the tumult, threw on his light armor, and rushed out in time to hear the cry of his assailant, and pluck the banderole from its place.
At sight of the moon with the cross on its face, his wrath was uncontrollable.
The Aga in command and all his assistants were relentlessly impaled.
There were other sorties in course of the siege, but never another surprise.
CHAPTER VIII

MAHOMMED TRIES HIS GUNS AGAIN

Hardly had the bodies making the sortie retired within the gate when the Janissaries on the eminence were trebly strengthened, and the noises in that quarter, the cracking of whips, the shouting of ox-drivers, the hammering betokened a prodigious activity.
The besieged, under delusion that the guns had been destroyed, could not understand the enemy.
Not until the second ensuing morning was the mystery solved.
The watchmen on the towers, straining to pierce the early light, then beheld the great bronze monster remounted and gaping at them through an embrasure, and other monsters of a like kind on either side of it, fourteen in all, similarly mounted and defended.
The warders on the towers, in high excitement, sent for Justiniani, and he in turn despatched a messenger to the Emperor.
Together on the Bagdad tower the two discussed the outlook.
"Your Majesty," said the Genoese, much chagrined, "the apostate Dacian must be master of his art.
He has restored the cannon I overthrew."
After a time Constantine replied: "I fear we have underrated the new Sultan.
Great as a father may be, it is possible for a son to be greater."
Perceiving the Emperor was again repenting the dismissal of Urban, the Captain held his peace until asked: "What shall we now do?"
"Your Majesty," he returned, "it is apparent our sally was a failure.
We slew a number of the infidels, and put their master--may God confound him!--to inconvenience, and nothing more.
Now he is on guard, we may not repeat our attempt.
My judgment is that we let him try his armament upon our walls.
They may withstand his utmost effort."
The patience this required was not put to a long test.
There was a sudden clamor of trumpets, and the Janissaries, taking to their saddles, and breaking right and left into divisions, cleared the battery front.
Immediately a vast volume of smoke hid the whole ground, followed by a series of explosions.
Some balls passing over the defences ploughed into the city; and as definitions of force, the sounds they made in going were awful; yet they were the least of the terrors.
Both the towers were hit, and they shook as if an earthquake were wrestling with them.
The air whitened with dust and fragments of crushed stone.
The men at the machines and culverins cowered to the floor.
Constantine and the Genoese gazed at each other until the latter bethought him, and ordered the fire returned.
And it was well done, for there is nothing which shall bring men round from fright like action.
Then, before there could be an exchange of opinion between the high parties on the tower, a man in half armor issued from the slowly rising cloud, and walked leisurely forward.
Instead of weapons, he carried an armful of stakes, and something which had the appearance of a heavy gavel.
After a careful examination of the ground to the gate, he halted and drove a stake, and from that point commenced zigzagging down the slope, marking each angle.
Justiniani drew nearer the Emperor, and said, in a low voice: "With new agencies come new methods.
The assault is deferred."
"Nay, Captain, our enemy must attack; otherwise he cannot make the moat passable."
"That, Your Majesty, was the practice.
Now he will gain the ditch by a trench."
"With what object?"
"Under cover of the trench, he will fill the ditch."
Constantine viewed the operation with increased gravity.
He could see how feasible it was to dig a covered way under fire of the guns, making the approach and the bombardment simultaneous; and he would have replied, but that instant a mob of laborers--so the spades and picks they bore bespoke them--poured from the embrasure of the larger gun, and, distributing themselves at easy working intervals along the staked line, began throwing up the earth on the side next the city.
Officers with whips accompanied and stood over them.
The engineer--if we may apply the modern term--was at length under fire of the besieged; still he kept on; only when he exhausted his supply of stakes did he retire, leaving it inferrible that the trench was to run through the opening in the cemetery to the bridge way before the gate.
At noon, the laborers being well sunk in the ground, the cannon again vomited fire and smoke, and with thunderous reports launched their heavy bullets at the towers.
Again the ancient piles shook from top to base.
Some of the balistiers were thrown down.
The Emperor staggered under the shock.
One ball struck a few feet below a merlon of the Bagdad, and when the dust blew away, an ugly crack was seen in the exposed face of the wall, extending below the roof.
While the inspection of damages immediately ordered is in progress, we take the liberty of transporting the reader elsewhere, that he may see the effect of this amazing warfare on other parties of interest in the tragedy.
Count Corti was with his guard at the foot of the tower when the first discharge of artillery took place.
He heard the loud reports and the blows of the shot which failed not their aim; he heard also the sound of the bullets flying on into the city, and being of a quick imagination, shuddered to think of the havoc they might inflict should they fall in a thickly inhabited district.
Then it came to him that the residence of the Princess Irene must be exposed to the danger.
Like a Christian and a lover, he, sought to allay the chill he felt by signing the cross repeatedly, and with unction, on brow and breast.
The pious performance brought no relief.
His dread increased.
Finally he sent a man with a message informing the Emperor that he was gone to see what damage the guns had done in the city.
He had not ridden far when he was made aware of the prevalence of an extraordinary excitement.
It seemed the entire population had been brought from their houses by the strange thunder, and the appalling flight of meteoric bodies over their roofs.
Men and women were running about asking each other what had happened.
At the corners he was appealed to:

"Oh, for Christ's sake, stop, and tell us if the world is coming to an end!"
Arid in pity lie answered: "Do not be so afraid, good people.
It is the Turks.
They are trying to scare us by making a great noise.
Go back into your houses."
"But the bullets which passed over us.
What of them?"
"Where did they strike?"
"On further.
God help the sufferers!"
One cry he heard so often it made an impression upon him:

"The _Panagia!_ Tell His Majesty, as he is a Christian, to bring the Blessed Madonna from the Chapel."
With each leap of his horse he was now nearing the alighting places of the missiles, and naturally the multiplying signs of terror he observed, together with a growing assurance that the abode of the Princess was in the range of danger, quickened his alarm for her.
The white faces of the women he met and passed without a word reminded him the more that she was subject to the same peril, and in thought of her he forgot to sympathize with them.
In Byzantium one might be near a given point yet far away; so did the streets run up and down, and here and there, their eccentricities in width and direction proving how much more accident and whim had to do with them originally than art or science.
Knowing this, the Count was not sparing of his horse, and as his blood heated so did his fancy.
If the fair Princess were unhurt, it was scarcely possible she had escaped the universal terror.
He imagined her the object of tearful attention from her attendants.
Or perhaps they had run away, and left her in keeping of the tender Madonna of Blacherne.
At last he reached a quarter where the throng of people compelled him to slacken his gait, then halt and dismount.
It was but a few doors from the Princess'.
One house--a frame, two stories--appeared the object of interest.
"What has happened?"
he asked, addressing a tall man, who stood trembling and praying to a crucifix in his hand.
"God protect us, Sir Knight!
See how clear the sky is, but a great stone--some say it was a meteor--struck this house.
There is the hole it made.
Others say it was a bullet from the Turks.--Save us, O Son of Mary!"
and he fell to kissing the crucifix.
"Was anybody hurt?"
the Count asked, shaking the devotee.
"Yes--two women and a child were killed.--Save us, O Son of God!
Thou hast the power from the Father."
The Count picked his way toward the house till he could get no further, so was it blocked by a mass of women on their knees, crying, praying, and in agony of fright.
There, sure enough, was a front beaten in, exposing the wrecked interior.
But who was the young woman at the door calmly directing some men bringing out the body of one apparently dead?
Her back was to him, but the sunlight was tangled in her uncovered hair, making gold of it.
Her figure was tall and slender, and there was a marvellous grace in her action.
Who was she?
The Count's heart was prophetic.
He gave the bridle rein to a man near by, and holding his sword up, pushed through the kneeling mass.
He might have been more considerate in going; but he was in haste, and never paused until at the woman's side.
"God's mercy, Princess Irene!"
he cried, "what dost thou here?
Are there not men to take this charge upon them?"
And in his joy at finding her safe, he fell upon his knees, and, without waiting for her to offer the favor, took one of her hands, and carried it to his lips.
"Nay, Count Corti, is it not for me to ask what thou dost here?"
Her face was solemn, and he could hardly determine if the eyes she turned to him were not chiding; yet they were full of humid violet light, and she permitted him to keep the hand while he replied:

"The Turk is for the time having his own way.
We cannot get to him....
I came in haste to--to see what his guns have done--or--why should I not say it?
Princess, I galloped here fearing thou wert in need of protection and help.
I remembered that I was thy accepted knight."
She understood him perfectly, and, withdrawing her hand, returned: "Rise, Count Corti, thou art in the way of these bearing the dead."
He stood aside, and the men passed him with their burden--a woman drenched in blood.
"Is this the last one?"
she asked them.
"We could find no other."
"Poor creature!
...
Yet God's will be done!
... Bear her to my house, and lay her with the others."
Then to the Count she said: "Come with me."
The Princess set out after the men.
Immediately the women about raised a loud lamentation; such as were nearest her cried out: "Blessings on you!"
and they kissed the hem of her gown, and followed her moaning and weeping.
The body was borne into the house, and to the chapel, and all who wished went in.
Before the altar, two others were lying lifeless on improvised biers, an elderly woman and a half-grown girl.
The Lady in picture above the altar looked down on them, as did the Holy Child in her arms; and there was much comfort to the spectators in the look.
Then, when the third victim was decently laid out, Sergius began the service for the dead.
The Count stood by the Princess, her attendants in group a little removed from them.
In the midst of the holy ministration, a sound like distant rolling thunder penetrated the chapel.
Every one present knew what it was by this time--knew at least it was not thunder--and they cried out, and clasped each other--from their knees many fell grovelling on the floor.
Sergius' voice never wavered.
Corti would have extended his arms to give the Princess support; but she did not so much as change color; her hands holding a silver triptych remained firm.
The deadly bullets were in the air and might alight on the house; yet her mind was too steadfast, her soul too high, her faith too exalted for alarm; and if the Count had been prone to love her for her graces of person, now he was prompted to adore her for her courage.
Outside near by, there was a crash as of a flying solid smiting another dwelling, and, without perceptible interval, an outcry so shrill and unintermitted it required no explanation.
The Princess was the first to speak.
"Proceed, Sergius," she said; nor might one familiar with her voice have perceived any alteration in it from the ordinary; then to the Count again: "Let us go out; there may be others needing my care."
At the door Corti said: "Stay, O Princess--a word, I pray."
She had only to look at his face to discover he was the subject of a fierce conflict of spirit.
"Have pity on me, I conjure you.
Honor and duty call me to the gate; the Emperor may be calling me; but how can I go, leaving you in the midst of such peril and horrors?"
"What would you have me do?"
"Fly to a place of safety."
"Where?"
"I will find a place; if not within these walls, then"--

He stopped, and his eyes, bright with passion, fell before hers; for the idea he was about giving his tongue would be a doubly dishonorable coinage, since it included desertion of the beleaguered city, and violation of his compact with Mahommed.
"And then?"
she asked.
And love got the better of honor.
"I have a ship in the harbor, O Princess Irene, and a crew devoted to me, and I will place you on its deck, and fly with you.
Doubt not my making the sea; there are not Christians and Mohammedans enough to stay me once my anchor is lifted, and my oars out; and on the sea freedom lives, and we will follow the stars to Italy, and find a home."
Again he stopped, his face this time wrung with sudden anguish; then he continued:

"God forgive, and deal with me mercifully!
I am mad!
... And thou, O Princess--do thou forgive me also, and my words and weakness.
Oh, if not for my sake, then for that which carried me away!
Or if thou canst not forget, pity me, pity me, and think of the wretchedness now my portion.
I had thy respect, if not thy love; now both are lost--gone after my honor.
Oh!
I am most miserable--miserable!"
And wringing his hands, he turned his face from her.
"Count Corti," she replied gently, "thou hast saved thyself.
Let the affair rest here.
I forgive the proposal, and shall never remind thee of it.
Love is madness.
Return to duty; and for me"--she hesitated--"I hold myself ready for the sacrifice to which I was born.
God is fashioning it; in His own time, and in the form He chooses, He will send it to me....
I am not afraid, and be thou not afraid for me.
My father was a hero, and he left me his spirit.
I too have my duty born within the hour--it is to share the danger of my kinsman's people, to give them my presence, to comfort them all I can.
I will show thee what thou seemest not to have credited--that a woman can be brave as any man.
I will attend the sick, the wounded, and suffering.
To the dying I will carry such consolation as I possess--all of them I can reach--and the dead shall have ministration.
My goods and values have long been held for the poor and unfortunate; now to the same service I consecrate myself, my house, my chapel, and altar....
There is my hand in sign of forgiveness, and that I believe thee a true knight.
I will go with thee to thy horse."
He bowed his head, and silently struggling for composure, carried the hand to his lips.
"Let us go now," she said.
They went out together.
Another dwelling had been struck; fortunately it was unoccupied.
In the saddle, he stayed to say: "Thy soul, O Princess Irene, is angelic as thy face.
Thou hast devoted thyself to the suffering.
Am I left out?
What word wilt thou give me?"
"Be the true knight thou art, Count Corti, and come to me as before."
He rode away with a revelation; that in womanly purity and goodness there is a power and inspiration beyond the claims of beauty.
The firing continued.
Seven times that day the Turks assailed the Gate St. Romain with their guns; and while a few of the stones discharged flew amiss into the city, there were enough to still further terrorize the inhabitants.
By night all who could had retreated to vaults, cellars, and such hiding-places as were safe, and took up their abodes in them.
In the city but one woman went abroad without fear, and she bore bread and medicines, and dressed wounds, and assuaged sorrows, and as a Madonna in fact divided worship with the Madonna in the chapel up by the High Residence.
Whereat Count Corti's love grew apace, though the recollection of the near fall he had kept him humble and circumspect.
The same day, but after the second discharge of the guns, Mahommed entered the part of his tent which, with some freedom, may be termed his office and reception-room, since it was furnished with seats and a large table, the latter set upon a heavily tufted rug, and littered over with maps and writing and drawing materials.
Notable amongst the litter was the sword of Solomon.
Near it lay a pair of steel gauntlets elegantly gilt.
One stout centre-tree, the main support of the roof of camel's hair, appeared gayly dressed with lances, shields, arms, and armor; and against it, strange to say, the companion of a bright red battle-flag, leant the banderole Count Corti had planted before the door the morning of the sally.
A sliding flap overhead, managed by cords in the interior, was drawn up, admitting light and air.
The office, it may be added, communicated by gay portieres with four other apartments, each having its separate centre-tree; one occupied by Kalil, the Vizier; one, a bed-chamber, so to speak; one, a stable for the imperial stud; the fourth belonged to no less a person than our ancient and mysterious acquaintance, the Prince of India.
Mahommed was in half-armor; that is, his neck, arms, and body were in chain mail, the lightest and most flexible of the East, exquisitely gold-washed, and as respects fashion exactly like the suit habitually affected by Count Corti.
His nether limbs were clad in wide trousers of yellow silk, drawn close at the ankles.
Pointed shoes of red leather completed his equipment, unless we may include a whip with heavy handle and long lash.
Could Constantine have seen him at the moment, he would have recognized the engineer whose performance in tracing the trench he had witnessed with so much interest in the morning.
The Grand Chamberlain received him with the usual prostration, and in that posture waited his pleasure.
"Bring me water.
I am thirsty."
The water was brought.
"The Prince of India now."
Presently the Prince appeared in the costume peculiar to him--a cap and gown of black velvet, loose trousers, and slippers.
His hair and beard were longer than when we knew him a denizen of Constantinople, making his figure seem more spare and old; otherwise he was unchanged.
He too prostrated himself; yet as he sank upon his knees, he gave the Sultan a quick glance, intended doubtless to discover his temper more than his purpose.
"You may retire."
This to the Chamberlain.
Upon the disappearance of the official, Mahommed addressed the Prince, his countenance flushed, his eyes actually sparkling.
"God is great.
All things are possible to him.
Who shall say no when he says yes?
Who resist when he bids strike?
Salute me, and rejoice with me, O Prince.
He is on my side.
It was he who spoke in the thunder of my guns.
Salute me, and rejoice.
Constantinople is mine!
The towers which have outlasted the ages, the walls which have mocked so many conquerors--behold them tottering to their fall!
I will make dust of them.
The city which has been a stumbling-block to the true faith shall be converted in a night.
Of the churches I will make mosques.
Salute me and rejoice!
How may a soul contain itself knowing God has chosen it for such mighty things?
Rise, O Prince and rejoice with me!"
He caught up the sword of Solomon, and in a kind of ecstasy strode about flourishing it.
The Prince, arisen, replied simply: "I rejoice with my Lord;" and folding his arms across his breast, he waited, knowing he had been summoned for something more serious than to witness an outburst so wild--that directly this froth would disappear, as bubbles vanish from wine just poured.
The most absolute of men have their ways--this was one of Mahommed's.
And behind his composed countenance the Jew smiled, for, as he read it, the byplay was an acknowledgment of his influence over the chosen of God.
And he was right.
Suddenly Mahommed replaced the sword, and standing before him, asked abruptly:

"Tell me, have the stars fixed the day when I may assault the Gabours?"
"They have, my Lord."
"Give it to me."
The Prince returned to his apartment, and came back with a horoscope.
"This is their decision, my Lord."
In his character of Messenger of the Stars, the Prince of India dispensed with every observance implying inferiority.
Without looking at the Signs, or at the planets in their Houses; without noticing the calculations accompanying the chart; glancing merely at the date in the central place, Mahommed frowned, and said:

"The twenty-ninth of May!
Fifty-three days!
By Allah and Mahomet arid Christ--all in one--if by the compound the oath will derive an extra virtue--what is there to consume so much time?
In three days I will have the towers lording this gate they call St. Romain in the ditch, and the ditch filled.
In three days, I say."
"Perhaps my Lord is too sanguine--perhaps he does not sufficiently credit the skill and resources of the enemy behind the gate--perhaps there is more to do than he has admitted into his anticipations."
Mahommed darted a look at the speaker.
"Perhaps the stars have been confidential with their messenger, and told him some of the things wanting to be done."
"Yes, my Lord."
The calmness of the Prince astonished Mahommed.
"And art thou permitted to be confidential with me?"
he asked.
"My Lord must break up this collection of his guns, and plant some of them against the other gates; say two at the Golden Gate, one at the Caligaria, and before the Selimbria and the Adrianople two each.
He will have seven left....
Nor must my Lord confine his attack to the landward side; the weakest front of the city is the harbor front, and it must be subjected.
He should carry there at least two of his guns."
"Sword of Solomon!"
cried Mahommed.
"Will the stars show me a road to possession of the harbor?
Will they break the chain which defends its entrance?
Will they sink or burn the enemy's fleet?"
"No; those are heroisms left for my Lord's endeavor."
"Thou dost taunt me with the impossible."
The Prince smiled.
"Is my Lord less able than the Crusaders?
I know he is not too proud to be taught by them.
Once, marching upon the Holy City, they laid siege to Nicea, and after a time discovered they could not master it without first mastering Lake Ascanius.
Thereupon they hauled their ships three leagues overland, and launched them in the lake."
[Footnote: VON HAMMER, _Hist.
de l'Emp.
Ottoman._]

Mahommed became thoughtful.
"If my Lord does not distribute the guns; if he confines his attack to St. Romain, the enemy, in the day of assault, can meet him at the breach with his whole garrison.
More serious, if the harbor is left to the Greeks, how can he prevent the Genoese in Galata from succoring them?
My Lord derives information from those treacherous people in the day; does he know of the intercourse between the towns by boats in the night?
If they betray one side, will they be true to the other?
My Lord, they are Christians; so are these with whom we are at war."
The Sultan sank into a seat; and satisfied with the impression he had made, the Prince wisely allowed him his thoughts.
"It is enough!"
said the former, rising.
Then fixing his eye on his confederate, he asked: "What stars told thee these things, O Prince?"
"My Lord, the firmament above is God's, and the sun and planets there are his mercifully to our common use.
But we have each of us a firmament of our own.
In mine, Reason is the sun, and of its stars I mention two--Experience and Faith.
By the light of the three, I succeed; when I refuse them, one or all, I surrender to chance."
Mahommed caught up the sword, and played with its ruby handle, turning it at angles to catch its radiations; at length he said:

"Prince of India, thou hast spoken like a Prophet.
Go call Kalil and Saganos."
CHAPTER IX

THE MADONNA TO THE RESCUE

We have given the opening of the siege of Byzantium by Mahommed with dangerous minuteness, the danger of course being from the critic.
We have posted the warders on their walls, and over against them set the enemy in an intrenched line covering the whole landward side of the city.
We have planted Mahommed's guns, and exhibited their power, making it a certainty that a breach in the wall must be sooner or later accomplished.
We have shown the effect of the fire of the guns, not only on the towers abutting the gate which was the main object of attack, but on the non-combatants, the women and children, in their terror seeking safety in cellars, vaults, and accessible underground retreats.
We have carefully assembled and grouped those of our characters who have survived to this trying time; and the reader is informed where they are, the side with which their fortunes are cast, their present relations to each other, and the conditions which environ them.
In a word, the reader knows their several fates are upon them, and the favors we now most earnestly pray are to be permitted to pass the daily occurrences of the siege, and advance quickly to the end.
Even battles can become monotonous in narrative.
The Sultan, we remark, adopted the suggestions of the Prince of India.
He distributed his guns, planting some of them in front of the several gates of the city.
To control the harbor, he, in modern parlance, erected a battery on a hill by Galata; then in a night, he drew a part of his fleet, including a number of his largest vessels, from Besich-tasch on the Bosphorus over the heights and hollows of Pera, a distance of about two leagues, and dropped them in the Golden Horn.
These Constantine attacked.
Justiniani led the enterprise, but was repulsed.
A stone bullet sunk his ship, and he barely escaped with his life.
Most of his companions were drowned; those taken were pitilessly hung.
Mahommed next collected great earthen jars--their like may yet be seen in the East--and, after making them air-tight, laid a bridge upon them out toward the single wall defending the harbor front.
At the further end of this unique approach he placed a large gun; and so destructive was the bombardment thus opened that fire-ships were sent against the bridge and battery.
But the Genoese of Galata betrayed the scheme, and it was baffled.
The prisoners captured were hanged in view of the Greeks, and in retaliation Constantine exposed the heads of a hundred and sixty Turks from the wall.
On the landward side Mahommed was not less fortunate.
The zigzag trench was completed, and a footing obtained for his men in the moat, whence they strove to undermine the walls.
Of the lives lost during these operations no account was taken, since the hordes were the victims.
Their bodies were left as debris in the roadway so expensively constructed.
Day after day the towers Bagdad and St. Romain were more and more reduced.
Immense sections of them tumbling into the ditch were there utilized.
Day after day the exchange of bullets, bolts, stones, and arrows was incessant.
The shouting in many tongues, heating of drums, and blowing of horns not seldom continued far into the night.
The Greeks on their side bore up bravely.
Old John Grant plied the assailants with his inextinguishable fire.
Constantine, in seeming always cheerful, never shirking, visited the walls; at night, he seconded Justiniani in hastening needful repairs.
Finally the steady drain upon the stores in magazine began to tell.
Provisions became scarce, and the diminution of powder threatened to silence the culverins and arquebuses.
Then the Emperor divided his time between the defences and Sancta Sophia--between duty as a military commander, and prayer as a Christian trustful in God.
And it was noticeable that the services at which he assisted in the ancient church were according to Latin rites; whereat the malcontents in the monasteries fell into deeper sullenness, and refused the dying the consolation of their presence.
Gennadius assumed the authority of the absent Patriarch, and was influential as a prophet.
The powerful Brotherhood of the St. James', composed of able-bodied gentry and nobles who should have been militant at the gates, regarded the Emperor as under ban.
Notaras and Justiniani quarrelled, and the feud spread to their respective followers.
One day, about the time the Turkish ships dropped, as it were, from the sky into the harbor, when the store of powder was almost exhausted, and famine menaced the city, five galleys were reported in the offing down the Marmora.
About the same time the Turkish flotilla was observed making ready for action.
The hungry people crowded the wall from the Seven Towers to Point Serail.
The Emperor rode thither in haste, while Mahommed betook himself to the shore of the sea.
A naval battle ensued under the eyes of the two.
[Footnote: The following is a translation of Von Hammer's spirited account of this battle:

"The 15th of April, 1453, the Turkish fleet, of more than four hundred sails, issued from the bay of Phidalia, and directing itself toward the mouth of the Bosphorus on the western side, cast anchor near the two villages to-day Besich-tasch.
A few days afterward five vessels appeared in the Marmora, one belonging to the Emperor, and four to the Genoese.
During the month of March they had been unable to issue from Scio; but a favorable wind arising, they arrived before Constantinople, all their sails unfurled.
A division of the Turkish fleet, more than a hundred and fifty in number, advanced to bar the passage of the Christian squadron and guard the entrance to the harbor.
The sky was clear, the sea tranquil, the walls crowded with spectators.
The Sultan himself was on the shore to enjoy the spectacle of a combat in which the superiority of his fleet seemed to promise him a certain victory.
But the eighteen galleys at the head of the division, manned by inexperienced soldiers, and too low at the sides, were instantly covered with arrows, pots of Greek fire, and a rain of stones launched by the enemy.
They were twice repulsed.
The Greeks and the Genoese emulated each other in zeal.
Flectanelli, captain of the imperial galley, fought like a lion; Cataneo, Novarro, Balaneri, commanding the Genoese, imitated his example.
The Turkish ships could not row under the arrows with which the water was covered; they fouled each other, and two took fire.
At this sight Mahommed could not contain himself; as if he would arrest the victory of the Greeks, he spurred his horse in the midst of the ships.
His officers followed him trying to reach the vessels combating only a stone's throw away.
The soldiers, excited by shame or by fear, renewed the attack, but without success, and the five vessels, favored by a rising wind, forced a passage through the opposition, and happily entered the harbor."]
The Christian squadron made the Golden Horn, and passed triumphantly behind the chain defending it.
They brought supplies of corn and powder.
The relief had the appearance of a merciful Providence, and forthwith the fighting was renewed with increased ardor.
Kalil the Vizier exhorted Mahommed to abandon the siege.
"What, retire now?
Now that the gate St. Romain is in ruins and the ditch filled?"
the Sultan cried in rage.
"No, my bones to Eyoub, my soul to Eblis first.
Allah sent me here to conquer."
Those around attributed his firmness, some to religious zeal, some to ambition; none of them suspected how much the compact with Count Corti had to do with his decision.
To the lasting shame of Christian Europe, the arrival of the five galleys, and the victory they achieved, were all of succor and cheer permitted the heroic Emperor.
But the unequal struggle wore on, and with each set of sun Mahommed's hopes replumed themselves.
From much fondling and kissing the sword of Solomon, and swearing by it, the steel communicated itself to his will; while on the side of the besieged, failures, dissensions, watching and labor, disparity in numbers, inferiority in arms, the ravages of death, and the neglect of Christendom, slowly but surely invited despair.
Weeks passed thus.
April went out; and now it is the twenty-third of May.
On the twenty-ninth--six days off--the stars, so we have seen, will permit an assault.
And on this day the time is verging midnight.
Between the sky and the beleaguered town a pall of clouds is hanging thick.
At intervals light showers filter through the pall, and the drops fall perpendicularly, for there is no wind.
And the earth has its wrap of darkness, only over the seven hills of the old capital it appears to be in double folds oppressively close.
Darkness and silence and vacancy, which do not require permission to enter by a gate, have possession of the streets and houses; except that now and then a solitary figure, gliding swiftly, turns a corner, pauses to hear, moves on again, and disappears as if it dropped a curtain behind it.
Desertion is the rule.
The hush is awful.
Where are the people?
To find each other friends go from cellar to cellar.
There are vaults and arched passages, crypts under churches and lordly habitations, deep, damp, mouldy, and smelling of rotten air, sheltering families.
In many districts all life is underground.
Sociality, because it cannot exist under such conditions save amongst rats and reptiles, ceased some time ago.
Yet love is not dead--thanks, O Heaven, for the divine impulse!--it has merely taken on new modes of expression; it shows itself in tears, never in laughter; it has quit singing, it moans; and what moments mothers are not on their knees praying, they sit crouched, and clasping their little ones, and listen pale with fear and want.
Listening is the universal habit; and the start and exclamation with which in the day the poor creatures recognize the explosive thunder of Mahommed's guns explain the origin of the habit.
At this particular hour of the twenty-third of May there are two notable exceptions to the statement that darkness, silence and vacancy have possession of the streets and houses.
By a combination of streets most favorable for the purpose, a thoroughfare had come into use along which traffic preferably drove its bulky commodities from St. Peter's on the harbor to the Gates St. Romain and Adrianople; its greater distance between terminal points being offset by advantages such as solidity, width and gentler grades.
In one of the turns of this very crooked way there is now a murky flush cast by flambeaux sputtering and borne in hand.
On either side one may see the fronts of houses without tenants, and in the way itself long lines of men tugging with united effort at some cumbrous body behind them.
There is no clamor.
The labor is heavy, and the laborers in earnest.
Some of them wear round steel caps, but the majority are civilians with here and there a monk, the latter by the Latin cross at his girdle an _azymite_.
Now and then the light flashes back from a naked torso streaming with perspiration.
One man in armor rides up and down the lines on horseback.
He too is in earnest.
He speaks low when he has occasion to stop and give a direction, but his face seen in flashes of the light is serious, and knit with purpose.
The movement of the lines is slow; at times they come to a dead stand-still.
If the halt appears too long the horseman rides back and comes presently to the black hull of a dismantled galley on rollers.
The stoppages are to shift the rollers forward.
When the shifting is done, he calls out: "Make ready, men!"
Whereupon every one in the lines catches hold of a rope, and at his "Now--for love of Christ!"
there follows a pull with might, and the hull drags on.
In these later days of the siege there are two persons actively engaged in the defence who are more wrought upon by the untowardness of the situation than any or all their associates--they are the Emperor and Count Corti.
There should be no difficulty in divining the cause of the former's distress.
It was too apparent to him that his empire was in desperate straits; that as St. Romain underwent its daily reduction so his remnant of State and power declined.
And beholding the dissolution was very like being an enforced witness of his own dying.
But Count Corti with the deepening of the danger only exerted himself the more.
He seemed everywhere present--now on the ruins of the towers, now in the moat, now foremost in a countermine, and daily his recklessness increased.
His feats with bow and sword amazed his friends.
He became a terror to the enemy.
He never tired.
No one knew when he slept.
And as note was taken of him, the question was continually on the lip, What possesses the man?
He is a foreigner--this is not his home--he has no kindred here--what can be his motive?
And there were who said it was Christian zeal; others surmised it was soldier habit; others again, that for some reason he was disgusted with life; yet others, themselves of sordid natures, said the Emperor affected him, and that he was striving for a great reward in promise.
As in the camps of the besiegers none knew the actual reason of Mahommed's persistence, so here the secret of the activity which left the Count without a peer in performance and daring went without explanation.
A few--amongst them the Emperor--were aware of the meaning of the red net about the Italian's neck--it shone so frequently through the smoke and dust of hourly conflict as to have become a subject of general observation--yet in the common opinion he was only the lady's knight; and his battle cry, _For Christ and Irene--Now!_ did but confirm the opinion.
Time and time again, Mahommed beheld the doughty deeds of his rival, heard his shout, saw the flash of his blade, sometimes near, sometimes afar, but always where the press was thickest.
Strange was it that of the two hosts he alone understood the other's inspiration?
He had only to look into his own heart, and measure the force of the passion there.
The horseman we see in charge of the removal of the galley-hulk this night of the twenty-third of May is Count Corti.
It is wanted at St. Romain.
The gate is a hill of stone and mortar, without form; the moat almost level from side to side; and Justiniani has decided upon a barricade behind a new ditch.
He will fill the hull with stones, and defend from its deck; and it must be on the ground by break of day.
Precisely as Count Corti was bringing the galley around the turn of the thoroughfare, Constantine was at the altar in Sancta Sophia where preparations for mass were making; that is, the priests were changing their vestments, and the acolytes lighting the tall candles.
The Emperor sat in his chair of state just inside the brass railing, unattended except by his sword-bearer.
His hands were on his knees, his head bowed low.
He was acknowledging a positive need of prayer.
The ruin at the gate was palpable; but God reigned, and might be reserving his power for a miraculous demonstration.
The preparation was about finished when, from the entrances of the Church opposite the nave, a shuffling of many feet was heard.
The light in that quarter was weak, and some moments passed before the Emperor perceived a small procession advancing, and arose.
The garbs were of orthodox Brotherhoods which had been most bitter in their denunciation.
None of them had approached the door of the holy house for weeks.
The imperial mind was greatly agitated by the sight.
Were the brethren recanting their unpatriotic resolutions?
Had Heaven at last given them an understanding of the peril of the city?
Had it brought to them a realization of the consequences if it fell under the yoke of the Turk?--That the whole East would then be lost to Christendom, with no date for its return?
A miracle!--and to God the glory!
And without a thought of himself the devoted man walked to the gate of the railing, and opening it, waited to receive the penitents.
Before him in front of the gate they knelt--in so far they yielded to custom.
"Brethren," he said, "this high altar has not been honored with your presence for many days.
As Basileus, I bid you welcome back, and dare urge the welcome in God's holy name.
Reason instructs me that your return is for a purpose in some manner connected with the unhappy condition in which our city and empire, not to mention our religion, are plunged.
Rise, one of you, and tell me to what your appearance at this solemn hour is due."
A brother in gray, old and stooped, arose, and replied:

"Your Majesty, it cannot be that you are unacquainted with the traditions of ancient origin concerning Constantinople and Hagia Sophia; forgive us, however, if we fear you are not equally well informed of a more recent prophecy, creditably derived, we think, and presume to speak of its terms.
'The infidels'--so the prediction runs--'will enter the city; but the instant they arrive at the column of Constantine the Great, an angel will descend from Heaven, and put a sword in the hands of a man of low estate seated at the foot of the column, and order him to avenge the people of God with it.
Overcome by sudden terror, the Turks will then take to flight, and be driven, not only from the city, but to the frontier of Persia.'
[Footnote: Von Hammer.]
This prediction relieves us, and all who believe in it, from fear of Mahommed and his impious hordes, and we are grateful to Heaven for the Divine intervention.
But, Your Majesty, we think to be forgiven, if we desire the honor of the deliverance to be accounted to the Holy Mother who has had our fathers in care for so many ages, and redeemed them miraculously in instances within Your Majesty's knowledge.
Wherefore to our purpose.... We have been deputed by the Brotherhoods in Constantinople, united in devotion to the Most Blessed Madonna of Blacherne, to pray your permission to take the _Panagia_ from the Church of the Virgin of Hodegetria, where it has been since the week of the Passover, and intrust it to the pious women of the city.
To-morrow at noon, Your Majesty consenting, they will assemble at the Acropolis, and with the banner at their head, go in procession along the walls and to every threatened gate, never doubting that at the sight of it the Sultan and his unbaptized hordes will be reft of breath of body or take to flight....
This we pray of Your Majesty, that the Mother of God may in these degenerate days have back the honor and worship accorded her by the Emperors and Greeks of former times."
The old man ceased, and again fell upon his knees, while his associate deputies rang the space with loud _Amens_.
It was well the light was dim, and the Emperor's face in shadow; it was well the posture of the petitioners helped hide him from close study; a feeling mixed of pity, contempt, and unutterable indignation seized him, distorting his features, and shaking his whole person.
Recantation and repentance!--Pledge of loyalty!--Offer of service at the gates and on the shattered walls!--Heaven help him!
There was no word of apology for their errors and remissness--not a syllable in acknowledgment of his labors and services--and he about to pray God for strength to die if the need were, as became the Emperor of a brave and noble people!
An instant he stood gazing at them--an instant of grief, shame, mortification, indignation, all heightened by a burning sense of personal wrong.
Ay, God help him!
"Bear with me a little," he said quietly, and passing the waiting priests, went and knelt upon a step of the altar in position to lay his head upon the upper step.
Minutes passed thus.
The deputies supposed him praying for the success of the morrow's display; he was in fact praying for self-possession to answer them as his judgment of policy demanded.
At length he arose, and returned to them, and had calmness to say:

"Arise, brethren, and go in peace.
The keeper of the Church will deliver the sacred banner to the pious women.
Only I insist upon a condition; if any of them are slain by the enemy, whom you and they know to have been bred in denial of womanly virtue, scorning their own mothers and wives, and making merchandise of their daughters--if any of them be slain, I say, then you shall bear witness to those who sent you to me that I am innocent of the blood-guilt.
Arise, and go in peace."
They marched out of the Church as they had come in, and he proceeded with the service.
Next day about ten o'clock in the morning there was a lull in the fighting at the Gate St. Romain.
It were probably better to say the Turks for some reason rested from their work of bringing stones, tree-trunks, earth in hand carts, and timbers wrenched from houses--everything, in fact, which would serve to substantially fill the moat in that quarter.
Then upon the highest heap of what had been the tower of Bagdad Count Corti appeared, a black shield on his arm, his bow in one hand, his banderole in the other.
"Have a care, have a care!"
his friends halloed.
"They are about firing the great gun."
Corti seemed not to hear, but deliberately planted the banderole, and blowing his trumpet three times, drew an arrow from the quiver at his back.
The gun was discharged, the bullet striking below him.
When the dust cleared away, he replied with his trumpet.
Then the Turks, keeping their distance, set up a cry.
Most of the arrows shot at him fell short.
Seeing their indisposition to accept his challenge, he took seat upon a stone.
Not long then until a horseman rode out from the line of Janissaries still guarding the eminence, and advanced down the left of the zigzag galloping.
He was in chain mail glistening like gold, but wore flowing yellow trousers, while his feet were buried in shoe-stirrups of the royal metal.
Looking over the small round black shield on his left arm, and holding a bow in the right hand, easy in the saddle, calm, confident, the champion slackened speed when within arrow flight, but commenced caracoling immediately.
A prolonged hoarse cry arose behind him.
Of the Christians, the Count alone recognized the salute of the Janissaries, still an utterance amongst Turkish soldiers, in literal translation: _The Padishah!
Live the Padishah!_ The warrior was Mahommed himself!
Arising, the Count placed an arrow at the string, and shouted, "_For Christ and Irene--Now!_" With the last word, he loosed the shaft.
Catching the missile lightly on his shield, Mahommed shouted back: "_Allah-il-Allah!_" and sent a shaft in return.
The exchange continued some minutes.
In truth, the Count was not a little proud of the enemy's performance.
If there was any weakness on his part, if his clutch of the notch at the instant of drawing the string was a trifle light, the fault was chargeable to a passing memory.
This antagonist had been his pupil.
How often in the school field, practising with blunted arrows, the two had joyously mimicked the encounter they were now holding.
At last a bolt, clanging dully, dropped from the Sultan's shield, and observing that it was black feathered, he swung from his seat to the ground, and, shifting the horse between him and the foe, secured the missile, and remounted.
_"Allah-il-Allah!
"_ he cried, slowly backing the charger out of range.
The Count repeated the challenge through his trumpet, and sat upon the stone again; but no other antagonist showing himself, he at length descended from the heap.
In his tent Mahommed examined the bolt; and finding the head was of lead, he cut it open, and extracted a scrip inscribed thus:

"To-day at noon a procession of women will appear on the walls.
You may know it by the white banner a monk will bear, with a picture of the Madonna painted on it.
_The Princess Irene marches next after the banner._"

Mahommed asked for the time.
It was half after ten o'clock.
In a few minutes the door was thronged by mounted officers, who, upon receiving a verbal message from him, sped away fast as they could go.
Thereupon the conflict was reopened.
Indeed, it raged more fiercely than at any previous time, the slingers and bowmen being pushed up to the outer edge of the moat, and the machines of every kind plied over their heads.
In his ignorance of the miracle expected of the Lady of the Banner, Mahommed had a hope of deterring the extraordinary march.
Nevertheless at the appointed hour, ten o'clock, the Church of the Virgin of Hodegetria was surrounded by nuns and monks; and presently the choir of Sancta Sophia issued from the house, executing a solemn chant; the Emperor followed in Basilean vestments; then the _Panagia_ appeared.
At sight of the picture of the Very Holy Virgin painted front view, the eyes upraised, the hands in posture of prayer, the breast covered by a portrait of the Child, the heads encircled by the usual nimbus, the mass knelt, uttering cries of adoration.
The Princess Irene, lightly veiled and attired in black, advanced, and, kissing the fringed corners of the hallowed relic, gathered the white staying ribbons in her hands; thereupon the monk appointed to carry it moved after the choir, and the nuns took places.
And there were tears and sighs, but not of fear.
The Mother of God would now assume the deliverance of her beloved capital.
As it had been to the Avars, and later to the Russians under Askold and Dir, it would be now to Mahommed and his ferocious hordes--all Heaven would arm to punish them.
They would not dare look at the picture twice, or if they did--well, there are many modes of death, and it will be for the dear Mother to choose.
Thus the women argued.
Possibly a perception of the failure in the defence, sharpened by a consciousness of the horrors in store for them if the city fell by assault, turned them to this.
There is no relief from despair like faith.
From the little church, the devotees of the Very Holy Virgin took their way on foot to the southeast, chanting as they went, and as they went their number grew.
Whence the accessions, none inquired.
They first reached a flight of steps leading to the banquette or footway along the wall near the Golden Gate.
The noise of the conflict, the shouting and roar of an uncounted multitude of men in the heat and fury of combat, not to more than mention the evidences of the conflict--arrows, bolts, and stones in overflight and falling in remittent showers--would have dispersed them in ordinary mood; but they were under protection--the Madonna was leading them--to be afraid was to deny her saving grace.
And then there was no shrinking on the part of the Princess Irene.
Even as she took time and song from the choir, they borrowed of her trust.
At the foot of the steps the singers turned aside to allow the _Panagia_ to go first.
The moment of miracle was come!
What form would the manifestation take?
Perhaps the doors and windows of Heaven would open for a rain of fire--perhaps the fighting angels who keep the throne of the Father would appear with swords of lightning--perhaps the Mother and Son would show themselves.
Had they not spared and converted the Khagan of the Avars?
Whatever the form, it were not becoming to stand between the _Panagia_ and the enemy.
The holy man carrying the ensign was trustful as the women, and he ascended the steps without faltering.
Gathering the ribbons a little more firmly in her hands, the Princess kept her place.
Up--up they were borne--Mother and Son.
Then the white banner was on the height--seen first by the Greeks keeping the wall, and in the places it discovered them, they fell upon their faces, next by the hordes.
And they--oh, a miracle, a miracle truly!--they stood still.
The bowman drawing his bow, the slinger whirling his sling, the arquebusers taking aim matches in hand, the strong men at the winches of the mangonels, all stopped--an arresting hand fell on them--they might have been changed to pillars of stone, so motionlessly did they stand and look at the white apparition.
_Kyrie Eleison_, thrice repeated, then _Christie Eleison_, also thrice repeated, descended to them in the voices of women, shrilled by excitement.
And the banner moved along the wall, not swiftly as if terror had to do with its passing, but slowly, the image turned outwardly, the Princess next it, the ribbons in her hands; after her the choir in full chant; and then the long array of women in ecstasy of faith and triumph; for before they were all ascended, the hordes at the edge of the moat, and those at a distance--or rather such of them as death or wounds would permit--were retreating to their entrenchment.
Nor that merely--the arrest which had fallen at the Golden Gate extended along the front of leaguerment from the sea to Blacherne, from Blacherne to the Acropolis.
So it happened that in advance of the display of the picture, without waiting for the _Kyrie Eleison_ of the glad procession, the Turks took to their defences; and through the city, from cellar, and vault, and crypt, and darkened passage, the wonderful story flew; and there being none to gainsay or explain it, the miracle was accepted, and the streets actually showed signs of a quick return to their old life.
Even the very timid took heart, and went about thanking God and the _Panagia Blachernitissa_.
And here and there the monks passed, sleek and blithe, and complacently twirling the Greek crosses at the whip-ends of their rosaries of polished horn buttons large as walnuts, saying:

"The danger is gone.
See what it is to have faith!
Had we kept on trusting the _azymites_, whether Roman cardinal or apostate Emperor, a muezzin would ere long, perhaps to-morrow, be calling to prayer from the dome of Hagia Sophia.
Blessed be the _Panagia!_ To-night let us sleep; and then--then we will dismiss the mercenaries with their Latin tongues."
But there will be skeptics to the last hour of the last day; so is the world made of kinds of men.
Constantine and Justiniani did not disarm or lay aside their care.
In unpatriotic distrust, they kept post behind the ruins of St. Romain, and saw to it that the labor of planting the hull of the galley for a new wall, strengthened with another ditch of dangerous depth and width, was continued.
And they were wise; for about four o'clock in the afternoon, there was a blowing of horns on the parapet by the monster gun, and five heralds in tunics stiff with gold embroidery, and trousers to correspond--splendid fellows, under turbans like balloons, each with a trumpet of shining silver--set out for the gate, preceding a stately unarmed official.
The heralds halted now and then to execute a flourish.
Constantine, recognizing an envoy, sent Justiniani and Count Corti to meet him beyond the moat, and they returned with the Sultan's formal demand for the surrender of the city.
The message was threatening and imperious.
The Emperor replied offering to pay tribute.
Mahommed rejected the proposal, and announced an assault.
The retirement of the hordes at sight of the _Panagia_ on the wall was by Mahommed's order.
His wilfulness extended to his love--he did not intend the Princess Irene should suffer harm.
CHAPTER X

THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ASSAULT

The artillery of Mahommed had been effective, though not to the same degree, elsewhere than at St. Romain.
Jerome the Italian and Leonardo di Langasco the Genoese, defending the port of Blacherne in the lowland, had not been able to save the Xiloporta or Wood Gate on the harbor front harmless; under pounding of the floating battery it lay in the dust, like a battered helmet.
John Grant and Theodore de Carystos looked at the green hills of Eyoub in front of the gate Caligaria or Charsias, assigned to them, through fissures and tumbles-down which made their hearts sore.
The Bochiardi brothers, Paul and Antonin, had fared no better in their defence of the gate Adrianople.
At the gate Selimbria, Theophilus Palaeologus kept the Imperial flag flying, but the outer faces of the towers there were in the ditch serving the uses of the enemy.
Contarino the Venetian, on the roof of the Golden Gate, was separated from the wall reaching northward to Selimbria by a breach wide enough to admit a chariot.
Gabriel Trevisan, with his noble four hundred Venetians, kept good his grip on the harbor wall from the Acropolis to the gate of St. Peter's.
Through the incapacity or treason of Duke Notaras, the upper portion of the Golden Horn was entirely lost to the Christians.
From the Seven Towers to Galata the Ottoman fleet held the wall facing the Marmora as a net of close meshes holds the space of water it is to drag.
In a word, the hour for assault had arrived, and from the twenty-fourth to evening of the twenty-eighth of May Mahommed diligently prepared for the event.
The attack he reduced to a bombardment barely sufficient to deter the besiegers from systematic repairs.
The reports of his guns were but occasionally heard.
At no time, however, was the energy of the man more conspicuous.
Previously his orders to chief officers in command along the line had been despatched to them; now he bade them to personal attendance; and, as may be fancied, the scene at his tent was orientally picturesque from sunrise to sunset.
Such an abounding of Moslem princes and princes not Moslem, of Pachas, and Beys, and Governors of Castles, of Sheiks, and Captains of hordes without titles; such a medley of costumes, and armor, and strange ensigns; such a forest of tall shafts flying red horse-tails; such a herding of caparisoned steeds; such a company of trumpeters and heralds--had seldom if ever been seen.
It seemed the East from the Euphrates and Red Sea to the Caspian, and the West far as the Iron Gates of the Danube, were there in warlike presence.
Yet for the most part these selected lions of tribes kept in separate groups and regarded each other askance, having feuds and jealousies amongst themselves; and there was reason for their good behavior--around them, under arms, were fifteen thousand watchful Janissaries, the flower of the Sultan's host, of whom an old chronicler has said, Each one is a giant in stature, and the equal of ten ordinary men.
Throughout those four days but one man had place always at Mahommed's back, his confidant and adviser--not Kalil, it is to be remarked, or Saganos, or the Mollah Kourani, or Akschem-sed-din the Dervish.
"My Lord," the Prince of India had argued when the Sultan resolved to summon his vassal chiefs to personal conference, "all men love splendor; pleasing the eye is an inducement to the intelligent; exciting the astonishment of the vulgar disposes them to submit to superiority in another without wounding their vanity.
The Rajahs in my country practise this philosophy with a thorough understanding.
Having frequently to hold council with their officials, into the tent or hall of ceremony they bring their utmost riches.
The lesson is open to my Lord."
So when his leaders of men were ushered into the audience, the interior of Mahommed's tent was extravagantly furnished, and their prostrations were at the step of a throne.
Nevertheless in consenting to the suggestion, the Sultan had insisted upon a condition.
"They shall not mistake me for something else than a warrior--a politician or a diplomatist, for instance--or think the heaviest blow I can deal is with the tongue or a pen.
Art thou hearing, Prince?"
"I hear, my Lord."
"So, by the tomb of the Prophet--may his name be exalted!--my household, viziers and all, shall stand at my left; but here on my right I will have my horse in panoply; and he shall bear my mace and champ his golden bit, and be ready to tread on such of the beggars as behave unseemly."
And over the blue and yellow silken rugs of Khorassan, with which the space at the right of the throne was spread, the horse, bitted and house led, had free range, an impressive reminder of the master's business of life.
As they were Christians or Moslems, Mahommed addressed the vassals honored by his summons, and admitted separately to his presence; for the same arguments might not be pleasing to both.
"I give you trust," he would say to the Christian, "and look for brave and loyal service from you....
I shall be present with you, and as an eyewitness judge of your valor, and never had men such incentives.
The wealth of ages is in the walls before us, and it shall be yours--money, jewels, goods and people--all yours as you can lay hands on it.
I reserve only the houses and churches.
Are you poor, you may go away rich; if rich, you may be richer; for what you get will be honorable earnings of your right hand of which none shall dispossess you--and to that treaty I swear.... Rise now, and put your men in readiness.
The stars have promised me this city, and their promises are as the breath of the God we both adore."
Very different in style and matter were his utterances to a Moslem.
"What is that hanging from thy belt?"
"It is a sword, my Lord."
"God is God, and there is no other God--_Amin!_ And he it was who planted iron in the earth, and showed the miner where it was hid, and taught the armorer to give it form, and harden it, even the blade at thy belt; for God had need of an instrument for the punishment of those who say 'God hath partners.'
... And who are they that say 'God hath partners--a Son and his Mother'?
Here have they their stronghold; and here have we been brought to make roads through its walls, and turn their palaces of unbelief into harems.
For that thou hast thy sword, and I mine--_Amin!_...
It is the will of God that we despoil these _Gabours_ of their wealth and their women; for are they not of those of whom it is said: 'In their hearts is a disease, and God hath increased their disease, and for them is ordained a painful punishment, because they have charged the Prophet of God with falsehood'?
That they who escape the sharpness of our swords shall be as beggars, and slaves, and homeless wanderers--such is the punishment, and it is the judgment of God--_Amin!_ ... That they shall leave all they have behind them--so also hath God willed, and I say it shall be.
I swear it.
And that they leave behind them is for us who were appointed from the beginning of the world to take it; that also God wills, and I say it shall be.
I swear it.
_Amin!_ ... What if the way be perilous, as I grant it is?
Is it not written: 'A soul cannot die except by permission of God, according to a writing of God, definite as to time'?
And if a man die, is it not also written: 'Repute not those slain in God's cause to be dead; nay, alive with God, they are provided for'?
They are people of the 'right hand,' of whom it is written: 'They shall be brought nigh God in the gardens of delight, upon inwrought couches reclining face to face.
Youths ever young shall go unto them round about with goblets and ewers, and a cup of flowing wine; and fruits of the sort which they shall choose, and the flesh of birds of the kind which they shall desire, and damsels with eyes like pearls laid up, we will give them as a reward for that which they have done.'
...
But the appointed time is not yet for all of us--nay, it is for the fewest--_Amin!_ ... And when the will of God is done, then for such as live, lo!
over the walls yonder are gold refined and coined, and gold in vessels, and damsels on silken couches, their cheeks like roses of Damascus, their arms whiter and cooler than lilies, and as pearls laid up are their eyes, and their bodies sweeter than musk on the wings of the south wind in a grove of palms.
With the gold we can make gardens of delight; and the damsels set down in the gardens, ours the fault if the promise be not made good as it was spoken by the Prophet--'Paradise shall be brought near unto the pious, to a place not distant from them, so they shall see it!'
...
Being of those who shall 'receive their books in the right hand,' more need not be said unto you.
I only reserve for myself the houses when you have despoiled them, and the churches.
Make ready yourself and your people, and tell them faithfully what I say, and swear to.
I will come to you with final orders.
Arise!"
[Footnote: For the quotations in this speech, see _Selections from the Koran_, by EDWARD WILLIAM LANE.]
From sunrise to sunset of the twenty-seventh Mahommed was in the saddle going with the retinue of a conqueror from chief to chief.
From each he drew a detachment to be held in reserve.
One hundred thousand men were thus detached.
"See to it," he said finally, "that you direct your main effort against the gate in front of you....
Put the wild men in the advance.
The dead will be useful in the ditch.... Have the ladders at hand.... At the sound of my trumpets, charge....
Proclaim for me that he who is first upon the walls shall have choice of a province.
I will make him governor.
God is God.
I am his servant, ordering as he has ordered."
On the twenty-eighth, he sent all the dervishes in camp to preach to the Moslems in arms; and of such effect were their promises of pillage and Paradise that after the hour of the fifth prayer, the multitude, in all quite two hundred and fifty thousand, abandoned themselves to transports of fanaticism.
Of their huts and booths they made heaps, and at night set fire to them; and the tents of the Pachas and great officers being illuminated, and the ships perfecting the blockade dressed in lights, the entrenchment from Blacherne to the Seven Towers, and the sea thence to the Acropolis, were in a continued brilliance reaching up to the sky.
Even the campania was invaded by the dazzlement of countless bonfires.
And from the walls the besieged, if they looked, beheld the antics of the hordes; if they listened, they heard the noise, in the distance, a prolonged, inarticulate, irregular clamor of voices, near by, a confusion of songs and cries.
At times the bray of trumpets and the roll of drums great and small shook the air, and smothered every rival sound.
And where the dervishes came, in their passage from group to group, the excitement arose out of bounds, while their dancing lent diablerie to the scene.
Assuredly there was enough in what they beheld to sink the spirit of the besieged, even the boldest of them.
The cry _Allah-il-Allah_ shouted from the moat was trifling in comparison with what they might have overheard around the bonfires.
"Why do you burn your huts?"
asked a prudent officer of his men.
"Because we will not need them more.
The city is for us to-morrow.
The Padishah has promised and sworn."
"Did he swear it?"
"Ay, by the bones of the Three in the Tomb of the Prophet."
At another fire, the following:

"Yes, I have chosen my palace already.
It is on the hill over there in the west."
And again:

"Tell us, O son of Mousa, when we are in the town what will you look for?"
"The things I most want."
"Well, what things?"
"May the Jinn fill thy stomach with green figs for such a question of my mother's son!
What things?
Two horses out of the Emperor's stable.
And thou--what wilt thou put thy hand to first?"
"Oh, I have not made up my mind!
I am thinking of a load of gold for my camel--enough to take my father and his three wives to Mecca, and buy water for them from the Zem-zem.
Praised be Allah!"
"Bah!
Gold will be cheap."
"Yes, as bezants; but I have heard of a bucket the unbelieving Greeks use at times for mixing wine and bread in.
It is when they eat the body of their God.
They say the bucket is so big it takes six fat priests to lift it."
"It is too big.
I'll gather the bezants."
"Well," said a third, with a loud Moslem oath, "keep to your gold, whether in pots or coin.
For me--for me"--

"Ha, ha!--he don't know."
"Don't I?
Thou grinning son of a Hindoo ape."
"What is it, then?"
"The thing which is first in thy mind."
"Name it."
"A string of women."
"Old or young?"
"An _hoo-rey-yeh_ is never old."
"What judgment!"
sneered the other.
"I will take some of the old ones as well."
"What for?"
"For slaves to wait on the young.
Was it not said by a wise man, 'Sweet water in the jar is not more precious than peace in the family'?"
Undoubtedly the evil genius of Byzantium in this peril was the Prince of India.
"My Lord," he had said, cynically, "of a truth a man brave in the day can be turned into a quaking coward at night; you have but to present him a danger substantial enough to quicken his imagination.
These Greeks have withstood you stoutly; try them now with your power a vision of darkness."
"How, Prince?"
"In view and hearing from the walls let the hordes kindle fires to-night.
Multiply the fires, if need be, and keep the thousands in motion about them, making a spectacle such as this generation has not seen; then"--

The singular man stopped to laugh.
Mahommed gazed at him in silent wonder.
"Then," he continued, "so will distorted fancy do its work, that by midnight the city will be on its knees praying to the Mother of God, and every armed man on the walls who has a wife or daughter will think he hears himself called to for protection.
Try it, my Lord, and thou mayst whack my flesh into ribbons if by dawn the general fear have not left but a half task for thy sword."
It was as the Jew said.
Attracted by the illumination in the sky, suggestive of something vast and terrible going on outside the walls, and still full of faith in a miraculous deliverance, thousands hastened to see the mercy.
What an awakening was in store for them!
Enemies seemed to have arisen out of the earth--devils, not men.
The world to the horizon's rim appeared oppressed with them.
Nor was it possible to misapprehend the meaning of what they beheld.
"To-morrow--to-morrow"--they whispered to each other--"God keep us!"
and pouring back into the streets, they became each a preacher of despair.
Yet--marvelous to say--the monks sallied from their cells with words of cheer.
"Have faith," they said.
"See, we are not afraid.
The Blessed Mother has not deserted her children.
Believe in her.
She is resolved to allow the _azymite_ Emperor to exhaust his vanity that in the last hour he and his Latin myrmidons may not deny her the merit of the salvation.
Compose yourselves, and fear not.
The angel will find the poor man at the column of Constantine."
The ordinary soul beset with fears, and sinking into hopelessness, is always ready to accept a promise of rest.
The people listened to the priestly soothsayers.
Nay, the too comforting assurance made its way to the defenders at the gates, and hundreds of them deserted their posts; leaving the enemy to creep in from the moat, and, with hooks on long poles, actually pull down some of the new defences.
It scarcely requires telling how these complications added weight to the cares with which the Emperor was already overladen.
Through the afternoon he sat by the open window of a room above the Cercoporta, or sunken gate under the southern face of his High Residence, [Footnote: This room is still to be seen.
The writer once visited it.
Arriving near, his Turkish _cavass_ requested him to wait a moment.
The man then advanced alone and cautiously, and knocked at the door.
There was a conference, and a little delay; after which the _cavass_ announced it was safe to go in.
The mystery was revealed upon entering.
A half dozen steaming tubs were scattered over the paved floor, and by each of them stood a scantily attired woman with a dirty _yashmak_ covering her face.
The chamber which should have been very sacred if only because there the last of the Byzantine Emperors composedly resigned himself to the inevitable, had become a filthy den devoted to one of the most ignoble of uses.
The shame is, of course, to the Greeks of Constantinople.]
watching the movements of the Turks.
The subtle prophet which sometimes mercifully goes before death had discharged its office with him.
He had dismissed his last hope.
Beyond peradventure the hardest task to one pondering his fate uprisen and standing before him with all its attending circumstances, is to make peace with himself; which is simply viewing the attractions of this life as birds of plumage in a golden cage, and deliberately opening the door, and letting them loose, knowing they can never return.
This the purest and noblest of the imperial Greeks--the evil times in which his race as a ruler was run prevent us from terming him the greatest--had done.
He was in armor, and his sword rested against the cheek of a window.
His faithful attendants came in occasionally, and spoke to him in low tones; but for the most part he was alone.
The view of the enemy was fair.
He could see their intrenchment, and the tents and ruder quarters behind it.
He could see the standards, many of them without meaning to him, the detachments on duty and watchful, the horsemen coming and going, and now and then a column in movement.
He could hear the shouting, and he knew the meaning of it all--the final tempest was gathering.
About four o'clock in the afternoon, Phranza entered the room, and going to his master's right hand, was in the act of prostrating himself.
"No, my Lord," said the Emperor, reaching out to stay him, and smiling pleasantly, "let us have done with ceremony.
Thou hast been true servant to me--I testify it, God hearing--and now I promote thee.
Be as my other self.
Speak to me standing.
To-morrow is my end of days.
In death no man is greater than another.
Tell me what thou bringest."
On his knees, the Grand Chamberlain took the steel-gloved hand nearest him, and carried it to his lips.
"Your Majesty, no servant had ever a more considerate and loving master."
An oppressive silence followed.
They were both thinking the same thought, and it was too sad for speech.
"The duty Your Majesty charged me with this morning "--thus Phranza upon recovery of his composure--"I attended to."
"And you found it?"
"Even as Your Majesty had warning.
The Hegumens of the Brotherhoods"--

"All of them, O Phranza?"
"All of them, Your Majesty--assembled in a cloister of the Pantocrator."
"Gennadius again!"
The Emperor's hands closed, and there was an impatient twitching of his lips.
"Though why should I be astonished?
Hark, my friend!
I will tell thee what I have as yet spoken to no man else.
Thou knowest Kalil the Vizier has been these many years my tributary, and that he hath done me many kindly acts, not always in his master's interest.
The night of the day our Christian ships beat the Turks the Grand Vizier sent me an account of a stormy scene in Mahommed's tent, and advised me to beware of Gennadius.
Ah, I had fancied myself prepared to drink the cup Heaven hath in store for me, lees and all, without a murmur, but men will be men until their second birth.
It is nature!
... Oh, my Phranza, what thinkest thou the false monk is carrying under his hood?"
"Some egg of treason, I doubt not."
"Having driven His Serenity, the pious and venerable Gregory, into exile, he aspires to succeed him."
"The hypocrite!--the impostor!--the perjured!--He, Patriarch!"
cried Phranza, with upraised eyes.
"And from whose hands thinkest thou he dreams of deriving the honor?"
"Not Your Majesty's."
The Emperor smiled faintly.
"No--he regards Mahommed the Sultan a better patron, if not a better Christian."
"Forbid it Heaven!"
and Phranza crossed himself repeatedly.
"Nay, good friend, hear his scheme, then thou mayst call the forbidding powers with undeniable reason....He undertook--so Kalil privily declared--if Mahommed would invest him with the Patriarchate, to deliver Constantinople to him."
"By what means?
He has no gate in keeping--he is not even a soldier."
"My poor Phranza!
Hast thou yet to learn that perfidy is not a trait of any class?
This gowned traitor hath a key to all the gates.
Hear him--I will ply the superstition of the Greeks, and draw them from the walls with a prophecy."
Phranza was able to cry out: "Oh!
that so brave a prince, so good a master should be at the mercy of--of such a"--

"With all thy learning, I see thou lackest a word.
Let it pass, let it pass--I understand thee....But what further hast thou from the meeting?"
Phranza caught the hand again, and laid his forehead upon it while he replied: "To-night the Brotherhoods are to go out, and renew the story of the angel, and the man at the foot of the column of Constantine."
The calmness of the Emperor was wonderful.
He gazed at the Turks through the window, and, after reflection, said tranquilly:

"I would have saved it--this old empire of our fathers; but my utmost now is to die for it--ay, as if I were blind to its unworthiness.
God's will be done, not mine!"
"Talk not of dying--O beloved Lord and master, talk not so!
It is not too late for composition.
Give me your terms, and I will go with them to"--

"Nay, friend, I have done better--I have made peace with myself....
I shall be no man's slave.
There is nothing more for me--nothing except an honorable death.
How sweet a grace it is that we can put so much glory in dying!
A day of Greek regeneration may come--then there may be some to do me honor--some to find worthy lessons in my life--perchance another Emperor of Byzantium to remember how the last of the Palaeologae accepted the will of God revealed to him in treachery and treason....
But there is one at the door knocking as he were in haste.
Let him enter."
An officer of the guard was admitted.
"Your Majesty," he said, after salutation, "the Captain Justiniani, and the Genoese, his friends, are preparing to abandon the gates."
Constantine seized his sword, and arose.
"Tell me about it," he said, simply.
"Justiniani has the new ditch at St. Romain nearly completed, and wanting some cannon, he made request for them of the High Admiral, who refused, saying, 'The foreign cowards must take care of themselves.'"
"Ride, sir, to the noble Captain, and tell him I am at thy heels."
"Is the Duke mad?"
Constantine continued, the messenger having departed.
"What can he want?
He is rich, and hath a family--boys verging on manhood, and of excellent promise.
Ah, my dear friend in need, what canst thou see of gain for him from Mahommed?"
"Life, your Majesty--life, and greater riches."
"How?
I did not suppose thou thoughtest so ill of men."
"Of some--of some--not all."
Then Phranza raised his head, and asked, bitterly: "If five galleys won the harbor, every Moslem sail opposing, why could not twelve or more do better?
Does not Mahommed draw his supplies by sea?"
The Emperor looked out of the window again, but not at the Turks.
"Lord Phranza," he said, presently, "thou mayst survive to-morrow's calamity; if so, being as thou art skilful with the pen, write of me in thy day of leisure two things; first, I dared not break with Duke Notaras while Mahommed was striving for my gates--he could and would have seized my throne--the Church, the Brotherhoods, and the people are with him--I am an _azymite._ Say of me next that I have always held the decree of union proclaimed by the Council of Florence binding upon Greek conscience, and had I lived, God helping me roll back this flood of Islam, it should have been enforced.... Hither--look hither, Lord Phranza"--he pointed out of the window--"and thou wilt see an argument of as many divisions as there are infidels beleaguering us why the Church of Christ should have one head; and as to whether the head should be Patriarch or Bishop, is it not enough that we are perishing for want of Western swords?"
--He would have fallen into silence again, but roused himself: "So much for the place I would have in the world's memory....
But to the present affair.
Reparation is due Justiniani and his associates.
Do thou prepare a repast in the great dining hall.
Our resources are so reduced I may not speak of it as a banquet; but as thou lovest me do thy best with what we have.
For my part, I will ride and summon every noble Greek in arms for Church and State, and the foreign captains.
In such cheer, perhaps, we can heal the wounds inflicted by Notaras.
We can at least make ready to die with grace."
He went out, and taking horse, rode at speed to the Gate St. Romain, and succeeded in soothing the offended Genoese.
At ten o'clock the banquet was held.
The chroniclers say of it that there were speeches, embraces, and a fresh resolution to fight, and endure the worst or conquer.
And they chose a battle-cry--_Christ and Holy Church._ At separating, the Emperor, with infinite tenderness, but never more knightly, prayed forgiveness of any he might have wronged or affronted; and the guests came one by one to bid him adieu, and he commended them to God, and the gratitude of Christians in the ages to come, and his hands were drenched with their tears.
From the Very High Residence he visited the gates, and was partially successful in arresting the desertions actually in progress.
Finally, all other duties done, his mind turning once more to God, he rode to Sancta Sophia, heard mass, partook of the Communion, and received absolution according to Latin rite; after which the morrow could hold no surprise for him.
And he found comfort repeating his own word: How sweet a grace it is that we can put so much glory in dying.
CHAPTER XI

COUNT CORTI IN DILEMMA

From the repast at Blacherne--festive it was in no sense--Count Corti escorted the Emperor to the door of Sancta Sophia; whence, by permission, and taking with him his nine Berbers, he rode slowly to the residence of the Princess Irene.
Slowly, we say, for nowhere in the pent area of Byzantium was there a soul more oppressed.
If he looked up, it was to fancy all the fortunate planets seated in their Houses helping Mahommed's star to a fullest flood of splendor; if he looked down, it was to see the wager--and his soul cried out, Lost!
Lost!
Though one be rich, or great, or superior in his calling, wherein is the profit of it if he have lost his love?
Besides the anguish of a perception of his rival's better fortune, the Count was bowed by the necessity of deciding certain consequences unforeseen at the time the wager was made.
The place of the surrender of the Princess was fixed.
Thinking forward now, he could anticipate the scene in the great church--the pack of fugitives, their terror and despair, the hordes raging amongst them.
How was he single-handed to save her unharmed in the scramble of the hour?
Thoughts of her youth, beauty, and rank, theretofore inspirations out of Heaven, set him to shivering with an ague more like fear than any he had ever known.
Nor was this all.
The surrender was by the terms to be to Mahommed himself.
The Sultan was to demand her of him.
He groaned aloud: "Oh, dear God and Holy Mother, be merciful, and let me die!"
For the first time it was given him to see, not alone that he might lose the woman to his soul all the sun is to the world, but her respect as well.
By what management was he to make the surrender without exposing the understanding between the conqueror and himself?
She would be present--she would see what took place--she would hear what was said.
And she would not be frightened.
The image of the Madonna above the altar in the nave would not be more calm.
The vaguest suspicion of a compact, and she the subject, would put her upon inquiry; then--"Oh, fool--idiot--insensate as my sword-grip!"
Thus, between groans, he scourged himself.
It was late, but her home was now a hospital filled with wounded men, and she its sleepless angel.
Old Lysander admitted him.
"The Princess Irene is in the chapel."
Thus directed, the Count went thither well knowing the way.
A soldier just dead was the theme of a solemn recital by Sergius.
The room was crowded with women in the deepest excitement of fear.
Corti understood the cause.
Poor creatures!
They had need of religious comfort.
A thousand ghosts in one view could not have overcome them as did the approach of the morrow.
At the right of the altar, he discovered the Princess in the midst of her attendants, who kept close to her, like young birds to the mother in alarm.
She was quiet and self-contained.
Apparently she alone heard the words of the reader; and whereas the Count came in a penitent--doubtful--in a maze--unknowing what to do or where to turn, one glance at her face restored him.
He resolved to tell her his history, omitting only the character in which he entered her kinsman's service, and the odious compact with Mahommed.
Her consent to accompany him to Sancta Sophia must be obtained; for that he was come.
His presence in the chapel awakened a suppressed excitement, and directly the Princess came to him.
"What has happened, Count Corti?
Why are you here?"
"To speak with you, O Princess Irene'

"Go with me, then."
She conducted him into a passage, and closed the door behind them.
"The floor of my reception room is overlaid with the sick and suffering--my whole house is given up to them.
Speak here; and if the news be bad, dear Count, it were mercy not to permit the unfortunates to hear you."
She was not thinking of herself.
He took the hand extended to him, and kissed it--to him it was the hand of more than the most beautiful woman in the world--it was the hand of a saint in white transfigurement.
"Thy imperial kinsman, O Princess, is at the church partaking of the Holy Communion, and receiving absolution."
"At this hour?
Why is he there, Count?"
Corti told her of the repast at the palace, and recounted the scene at parting.
"It looks like despair.
Can it be the Emperor is making ready to die?
Answer, and fear not for me.
My life has been a long preparation.
He believes the defence is lost--the captains believe so--and thou?"
"O Princess, it is terrible saying, but I too expect the judgment of God in the morning."
The hall was so dimly lighted he could not see her face; but the nerve of sympathy is fine--he felt she trembled.
Only a moment--scarcely longer than taking a breath--then she answered:

"Judgment is for us all.
It will find me here."
She moved as if to return to the chapel; but he stepped before her, and drawing out a chair standing by the door, said, firmly, yet tenderly:

"You are weary.
The labor of helping the unfortunate these many days--the watching and anxiety--have been trying upon you.
Sit, I pray, and hear me."
She yielded with a sigh.
"The judgment which would find you here, O Princes, would not be death, but something more terrible, so terrible words burn in thinking of it.
I have sworn to defend you: and the oath, and the will to keep it, give me the right to determine where and how the defence shall be made.
If there are advantages, I want them, for your sweet sake."
He stopped to master his feeling.
"You have never stood on the deck of a ship in wreck, and seen the sea rush in to overwhelm it," he went on presently: "I have; and I declare to you, O beloved lady, nothing can be so like to-morrow when the hordes break into the city, as that triumph of waters; and as on the deck there was no place of safety for the perishing crew, neither will there be place of safety for man, woman, or child in Byzantium then--least of all for the kinswoman of the Emperor--for her--permit me to say it--whose loveliness and virtue are themes for story-tellers throughout the East.
As a prize--whether for ransom or dishonor--richer than the churches and the palaces, and their belongings, be they jewels or gold, or anointed crown, or bone of Saint, or splinter of the True Cross, or shred from the shirt of Christ--to him who loves her, a prize of such excellence that glory, even the glory Mahommed is now dreaming of when he shall have wrenched the keys of the gates from their rightful owner dead in the bloody breach, would pale if set beside it for comparison, and sink out of sight--think you she will not be hunted?
Or that the painted Mother above the altar, though it spoke through a miraculous halo, could save her when found?
No, no, Princess, not here, not here!...
You know I love you; in an unreasoning moment I dared tell you so; and you may think me passion-blind, and that I hung the vow to defend you upon my soul's neck, thinking it light as this favor you were pleased to give me; that love being a braggart, therefore I am a braggart.
Let me set myself right in your opinion--your good opinion, O Princess, for it is to me a world of such fair shining I dream of it as of a garden in Paradise....
If you do not know how hardly I have striven in this war, send, I pray, and ask any of the captains, or the most Christian sovereign I have just left making his peace with God.
Some of them called me mad, but I pardoned them--they did not know the meaning of my battle-cry--'For Christ and Irene'--that I was venturing life less for Constantinople, less for religion--I almost said, less for Christ--than for you, who are all things in one to me, the fairest on earth, the best in Heaven.... At last, at last I am driven to admit we may fail--that to-morrow, whether I am here or there, at your side or under the trampling, you may be a prisoner at mercy."
At these words, of infinite anguish in utterance, the Princess shuddered, and looked up in silent appeal.
"Attend me now.
You have courage above the courage of women; therefore I may speak with plainness.... What will become of you--I give the conclusion of many wrangles with myself--what will become of you depends upon the hands which happen to be laid on you first.
O Princess, are you giving me heed?
Do you comprehend me?"
"The words concern me more than life, Count."
"I may go on then....
I have hope of saving your life and honor.
You have but to do what I advise.
If you cannot trust me, further speech were idleness, and I might as well take leave of you.
Death in many forms will be abroad to-morrow--nothing so easily found."
"Count Corti," she returned, "if I hesitate pledging myself, it is not because of distrust.
I will hear you."
"It is well said, dear lady."
He stopped--a pleasant warmth was in his heart--a perception, like dim light, began breaking through the obscurities in his mind.
To this moment, in fact, he had trouble gaining his own consent to the proposal on his tongue; it seemed so like treachery to the noble woman--so like a cunning inveiglement to deliver her to Mahommed under the hated compact.
Now suddenly the proposal assumed another appearance--it was the best course--the best had there been no wager, no compact, no obligation but knightly duty to her.
As he proceeded, this conviction grew clearer, bringing him ease of conscience and the subtle influence of a master arguing right.
He told her his history then, holding nothing back but the two points mentioned.
Twice only she interrupted him.
"Your mother, Count Corti--poor lady--how she has suffered!
But what happiness there is in store for her!"
And again: "How wonderful the escape from the falsehoods of the Prophet!
There is no love like Christ's love unless--unless it be a mother's."
At the conclusion, her chin rested in the soft palm of her hand, and the hand, unjewelled, was white as marble just carven, and, like the arm, a wonder of grace.
Of what was she thinking?--Of him?
Had he at last made an impression upon her?
What trifles serve the hope of lovers!
At length she asked:

"Then, O Count, thou wert his playmate in childhood?"
A bitter pang struck him--that pensiveness was for Mahommed--yet he answered: "I was nearest him until he took up his father's sword."
"Is he the monster they call him?"
"To his enemies, yes--and to all in the road to his desires, yes--but to his friends there was never such a friend."
"Has he heart to"--

The omission, rather than the question, hurt him--still he returned:

"Yes, once he really loves."
Then she appeared to awake.
"To the narrative now--Forgive my wandering."
The opportunity to return was a relief to him, and he hastened to improve it.
"I thank you for grace, O Princess, and am reminded of the pressure of time.
I must to the gate again with the Emperor....
This is my proposal.
Instead of biding here to be taken by some rapacious hordesman, go with me to Sancta Sophia, and when the Sultan comes thither--as he certainly will--deliver yourself to him.
If, before his arrival, the plunderers force the doors of the holy house, I will stand with you, not, Princess, as Count Corti the Italian, but Mirza the Emir and Janissary, appointed by the Sultan to guard you.
My Berbers will help the assumption."
He had spoken clearly, yet she hesitated.
"Ah," he said, "you doubt Mahommed.
He will be upon honor.
The glory-winners, Princess, are those always most in awe of the judgment of the world."
Yet she sat silent.
"Or is it I who am in your doubt?"
"No, Count.
But my household--my attendants--the poor creatures are trembling now--some of them, I was about saying, are of the noblest families in Byzantium, daughters of senators and lords of the court.
I cannot desert them--no, Count Corti, not to save myself.
The baseness would be on my soul forever.
They must share my fortune, or I their fate."
Still she was thinking of others!
More as a worshipper than lover, the Count replied: "I will include them in my attempt to save you.
Surely Heaven will help me, for your sake, O Princess."
"And I can plead for them with him.
Count Corti, I will go with you."
The animation with which she spoke faded in an instant.
"But thou--O my friend, if thou shouldst fall?"
"Nay, let us be confident.
If Heaven does not intend your escape, it would be merciful, O beloved lady, did it place me where no report of your mischance and sorrows can reach me.
Looking at the darkest side, should I not come for you, go nevertheless to the Church.
Doubt not hearing of the entry of the Turks.
Seek Mahommed, if possible, and demand his protection.
Tell him, I, Mirza the Emir, counselled you.
On the other side, be ready to accompany me.
Make preparation to-night--have a chair at hand, and your household assembled--for when I come, time will be scant.... And now, God be with you!
I will not say be brave--be trustful."
She extended her hand, and he knelt, and kissed it.
"I will pray for you, Count Corti."
"Heaven will hear you."
He went out, and rejoining the Emperor, rode with him from the Church to Blacherne.
CHAPTER XII

THE ASSAULT

The bonfires of the hordes were extinguished about the time the Christian company said their farewells after the last supper in the Very High Residence, and the hordes themselves appeared to be at rest, leaving Night to reset her stars serenely bright over the city, the sea, and the campania.
To the everlasting honor of that company, be it now said, they could under cover of the darkness have betaken themselves to the ships and escaped; yet they went to their several posts.
Having laid their heads upon the breast of the fated Emperor, and pledged him their lives, there is no account of one in craven refuge at the break of day.
The Emperor's devotion seems to have been a communicable flame.
This is the more remarkable when it is remembered that in the beginning the walls were relied upon to offset the superiority of the enemy in numbers, while now each knight and man-at-arms knew the vanity of that reliance--knew himself, in other words, one of scant five thousand men--to such diminished roll had the besieged been reduced by wounds, death and desertion--who were to muster on the ruins of the outer wall, or in the breaches of the inner, and strive against two hundred and fifty thousand goaded by influences justly considered the most powerful over ferocious natures--religious fanaticism and the assurance of booty without limit.
The silence into which the Turkish host was sunk did not continue a great while.
The Greeks on the landward walls became aware of a general murmur, followed shortly by a rumble at times vibrant--so the earth complains of the beating it receives from vast bodies of men and animals in hurried passage.
"The enemy is forming," said John Grant to his associate Carystos, the archer.
Minotle, the Venetian bayle, listening from the shattered gate of Adrianople, gave order: "Arouse the men.
The Turks are coming."
Justiniani, putting the finishing touches upon his masked repairs behind what had been the alley or passage between the towers Bagdad and St. Romain, was called to by his lookout: "Come up, Captain--the infidels are stirring--they seem disposed to attack."
"No," the Captain returned, after a brief observation, "they will not attack to-night--they are getting ready."
None the less, without relieving his working parties, he placed his command in station.
At Selimbria and the Golden Gate the Christians stood to arms.
So also between the gates.
Then a deep hush descended upon the mighty works--mighty despite the slugging they had endured--and the silence was loaded with anxiety.
For such of my readers as have held a night-watch expectant of battle at disadvantage in the morning it will be easy putting themselves in the place of these warders at bay; they can think their thoughts, and hear the heavy beating of their hearts; they will remember how long the hours were, and how the monotony of the waiting gnawed at their spirits until they prayed for action, action.
On the other hand, those without the experience will wonder how men can bear up bravely in such conditions--and that is a wonder.
In furtherance of his plan, Mahommed drew in his irregulars, and massed them in the space between the intrenchment and the ditch; and by bringing his machines and small guns nearer the walls, he menaced the whole front of defence with a line amply provided with scaling ladders and mantelets.
Behind the line he stationed bodies of horsemen to arrest fugitives, and turn them back to the fight.
His reserves occupied the intrenchments.
The Janissaries were retained at his quarters opposite St. Romain.
The hordes were clever enough to see what the arrangement portended for them, and they at first complained.
"What, grumble, do they?"
Mahommed answered.
"Ride, and tell them I say the first choice in the capture belongs to the first over the walls.
Theirs the fault if the city be not an empty nest to all who come after them."
The earth in its forward movement overtook the moon just before daybreak; then in the deep hush of expectancy and readiness, the light being sufficient to reveal to the besieged the assault couchant below them, a long-blown flourish was sounded by the Turkish heralds from the embrasure of the great gun.
Other trumpeters took up the signal, and in a space incredibly short it was repeated everywhere along the line of attack.
A thunder of drums broke in upon the music.
Up rose the hordes, the archers and slingers, and the ladder bearers, and forward, like a bristling wave, they rushed, shouting every man as he pleased.
In the same instant the machines and light guns were set in operation.
Never had the old walls been assailed by such a tempest of bolts, arrows, stones and bullets--never had their echoes been awakened by an equal explosion of human voices, instruments of martial music, and cannon.
The warders were not surprised by the assault so much as by its din and fury; and when directly the missiles struck them, thickening into an uninterrupted pouring rain, they cowered behind the merlons, and such other shelters as they could find.
This did not last long--it was like the shiver and gasp of one plunged suddenly into icy water.
The fugitives were rallied, and brought back to their weapons, and to replying in kind; and having no longer to shoot with care, the rabble fusing into a compact target, especially on the outer edge of the ditch, not a shaft, or bolt, or stone, or ball from culverin went amiss.
Afterwhile, their blood warming with the work, and the dawn breaking, they could see their advantage of position, and the awful havoc they were playing; then they too knew the delight in killing which more than anything else proves man the most ferocious of brutes.
The movement of the hordes was not a dash wholly without system--such an inference would be a great mistake.
There was no pretence of alignment or order--there never is in such attacks--forlorn hopes, receiving the signal, rush on, each individual to his own endeavor; here, nevertheless, the Pachas and Beys directed the assault, permitting no blind waste of effort.
They hurled their mobs at none but the weak places--here a breach, there a dismantled gate.
Thousands were pushed headlong into the moat.
The ladders then passed down to such of them as had footing were heavy, but they were caught willingly; if too short, were spliced; once planted so as to bring the coping of the wall in reach, they swarmed with eager adventurers, who, holding their shields and pikes overhead, climbed as best they could.
Those below cheered their comrades above, and even pushed them up.
"The spoils--think of the spoils--the gold, the women!...
_Allah-il-Allah!_... Up, up--it is the way to Paradise!"
Darts and javelins literally cast the climbers in a thickened shade.
Sometimes a ponderous stone plunging down cleaned a ladder from top to bottom; sometimes, waiting until the rounds were filled, the besieged applied levers, and swung a score and more off helpless and shrieking.
No matter--_Allah-il-Allah!_ The living were swift to restore and attempt the fatal ascents.
Every one dead and every one wounded became a serviceable clod; rapidly as the dump and cumber of humanity filled the moat the ladders extended their upward reach; while drum-beat, battle-cry, trumpet's blare, and the roar of cannon answering cannon blent into one steady all-smothering sound.
In the stretches of space between gates, where the walls and towers were intact, the strife of the archers and slingers was to keep the Greeks occupied, lest they should reenforce the defenders hard pressed elsewhere.
During the night the blockading vessels had been warped close into the shore, and, the wall of the seafront being lower than those on the land side, the crews, by means of platforms erected on the decks, engaged the besieged from a better level.
There also, though attempts at escalade were frequent, the object was chiefly to hold the garrison in place.
In the harbor, particularly at the Wood Gate, already mentioned as battered out of semblance to itself by the large gun on the floating battery, the Turks exerted themselves to effect a landing; but the Christian fleet interposed, and there was a naval battle of varying fortune.
So, speaking generally, the city was wrapped in assault; and when the sun at last rode up into the clear sky above the Asiatic heights, streets, houses, palaces, churches--the hills, in fact, from the sea to the Tower of Isaac--were shrouded in ominous vapor, through which such of the people as dared go abroad flitted pale and trembling; or if they spoke to each other, it was to ask in husky voices, What have you from the gates?
Passing now to the leading actors in this terrible tragedy.
Mahommed retired to his couch early the night previous.
He knew his orders were in course of execution by chiefs who, on their part, knew the consequences of failure.
The example made of the Admiral in command of the fleet the day the five relieving Christian galleys won the port was fresh in memory.
[Footnote: He was stretched on the ground and whipped like a common malefactor.]
"To-morrow, to-morrow," he kept repeating, while his pages took off his armor, and laid the pieces aside.
"To-morrow, to-morrow," lingered in his thoughts, when, his limbs stretched out comfortably on the broad bronze cot which served him for couch, sleep crept in as to a tired child, and laid its finger of forgetfulness upon his eyelids.
The repetition was as when we run through the verse of a cheerful song, thinking it out silently, and then recite the chorus aloud.
Once he awoke, and, sitting up, listened.
The mighty host which had its life by his permission was quiet--even the horses in their apartment seemed mindful that the hour was sacred to their master.
Falling to sleep again, he muttered: "To-morrow, to-morrow--Irene and glory.
I have the promise of the stars."
To Mahommed the morrow was obviously but a holiday which was bringing him the kingly part in a joyous game--a holiday too slow in coming.
About the third hour after midnight he was again awakened.
A man stood by his cot imperfectly shading the light of a lamp with his hand.
"Prince of India!"
exclaimed Mahommed, rising to a sitting posture.
"It is I, my Lord."
"What time is it?"
The Prince gave him the hour.
"Is it so near the break of day?"
Mahommed yawned.
"Tell me"--he fixed his eyes darkly on the visitor--"tell me first why thou art here?"
"I will, my Lord, and truly.
I wished to see if you could sleep.
A common soul could not.
It is well the world has no premonitory sense."
"Why so?"
"My Lord has all the qualities of a conqueror."
Mahommed was pleased.
"Yes, I will make a great day of to-morrow.
But, Prince of India, what shadows are disturbing thee?
Why art thou not asleep?"
"I too have a part in the day, my Lord."
"What part?"
"I will fight, and"--

Mahommed interrupted him with a laugh.
"Thou!"
and he looked the stooped figure over from head to foot.
"My Lord has two hands--I have four--I will show them."
Returning to his apartment, the Prince reappeared with Nilo.
"Behold, my Lord!"
The black was in the martial attire of a king of Kash-Cush--feathered coronet, robe of blue and red hanging from shoulder to heel, body under the robe naked to the waist, assegai in the oft-wrapped white sash, skirt to the knees glittering with crescents and buttons of silver, sandals beaded with pearls.
On his left arm depended a shield rimmed and embossed with brass; in his right hand he bore a club knotted, and of weight to fell a bull at a blow.
Without the slightest abashment, but rather as a superior, the King looked down at the young Sultan.
"I see--I understand--I welcome the four hands of the Prince of India," Mahommed said, vivaciously; then, giving a few moments of admiration to the negro, he turned, and asked:

"Prince, I have a motive for to-morrow--nay, by the cool waters of Paradise, I have many motives.
Tell me thine.
In thy speech and action I have observed a hate for these Greeks deep as the Shintan's for God.
Why?
What have they done to thee?"
"They are Christians," the Jew returned, sullenly.
"That is good, Prince, very good--even the Prophet judged it a justification for cleaning the earth of the detestable sect--yet it is not enough.
I am not old as thou"--Mahommed lost the curious gleam which shone in the visitor's eyes--"I am not old as thou art; still I know hate like thine must be from a private grievance."
"My Lord is right.
To-morrow I will leave the herd to the herd.
In the currents of the fight I will hunt but one enemy--Constantine.
Judge thou my cause."
Then he told of Lael--of his love for her--of her abduction by Demedes--his supplication for the Emperor's assistance--the refusal.
"She was the child of my soul," he continued, passionately.
"My interest in life was going out; she reinspired it.
She was the promise of a future for me, as the morning star is of a gladsome day.
I dreamed dreams of her, and upon her love builded hopes, like shining castles on high hills.
Yet it was not enough that the Greek refused me his power to discover and restore her.
She is now in restraint, and set apart to become the wife of a Christian--a Christian priest--may the fiends juggle for his ghost!--To-morrow I will punish the tyrant--I will give him a dog's death, and then seek her.
Oh!
I will find her--I will find her--and by the light there is in love, I will show him what all of hell there can be in one man's hate!"
For once the cunning of the Prince overreached itself.
In the rush of passion he forgot the exquisite sensory gifts of the potentate with whom he was dealing; and Mahommed, observant even while shrinking from the malignant fire in the large eyes, discerned incoherencies in the tale, and that it was but half told; and while he was resolving to push his Messenger of the Stars to a full confession, a distant rumble invaded the tent, accompanied by a trample of feet outside.
"It is here, Prince of India--the day of Destiny.
Let us get ready, thou for thy revenge, I for glory and"--Irene was on his tongue, but he suppressed the name.
"Call my chamberlain and equerry.... On the table there thou mayst see my arms--a mace my ancestor Ilderim [Footnote: Bajazet.]
bore at Nicopolis, and thy sword of Solomon.... God is great, and the Jinn and the Stars on my side, what have we to fear?"
Within half an hour he rode out of the tent.
"Blows the wind to the city or from it?"
he asked his chief Aga of Janissaries.
"Toward the city, my Lord."
"Exalted be the name of the Prophet!
Set the Flower of the Faithful in order--a column of front wide as the breach in the gate--and bring the heralds.
I shall be by the great gun."
Pushing his horse on the parapet, he beheld the space before him, down quite to the moat--every trace of the cemetery had disappeared--dark with hordes assembled and awaiting the signal.
Satisfied, happy, he looked then toward the east.
None better than he knew the stars appointed to go before the sun--their names were familiar to him--now they were his friends.
At last a violet corona infinitely soft glimmered along the hill tops beyond Scutari.
"Stand out now," he cried to the five in their tabards of gold--"stand out now, and as ye hope couches in Paradise, blow--blow the stones out of their beds yonder--God was never so great!"
Then ensued the general advance which has been described, except that here, in front of St. Romain, there was no covering the assailants with slingers and archers.
The fill in the ditch was nearly level with the outer bank, from which it may be described as an ascending causeway.
This advantage encouraged the idea of pouring the hordesmen _en masse_ over the hill composed of the ruins of what had been the towers of the gate.
There was an impulsive dash under incitement of a mighty drumming and trumpeting--a race, every man of the thousands engaged in it making for the causeway--a jam--a mob paralyzed by its numbers.
They trampled on each other--they fought, and in the rebound were pitched in heaps down the perpendicular revetment on the right and left of the fill.
Of those thus unfortunate the most remained where they fell, alive, perhaps, but none the less an increasing dump of pikes, shields, and crushed bodies; and in the roar above them, cries for help, groans, and prayers were alike unheard and unnoticed.
All this Justiniani had foreseen.
Behind loose stones on top of the hill, he had collected culverins, making, in modern phrase, a masked battery, and trained the pieces to sweep the causeway; with them, as a support, he mixed archers and pikemen.
On either flank, moreover, he stationed companies similarly armed, extending them to the unbroken wall, so there was not a space in the breach undefended.
The Captain, on watch and expectant, heard the signal.
"To the Emperor at Blacherne," he bade; "and say the storm is about to break.
Make haste."
Then to his men: "Light the matches, and be ready to throw the stones down."
The hordesmen reached the edge of the ditch; that moment the guns were unmasked, and the Genoese leader shouted:

"Fire, my men!--_Christ and Holy Church!_"

Then from the Christian works it was bullet, bolt, stone, and shaft, making light of flimsy shield and surcoat of hide; still the hordesmen pushed on, a river breasting an obstruction.
Now they were on the causeway.
Useless facing about--behind them an advancing wall--on both sides the ditch.
Useless lying down--that was to be smothered in bloody mire.
Forward, forward, or die.
What though the causeway was packed with dead and wounded?--though there was no foothold not slippery?--though the smell of hot blood filled every nostril?--though hands thrice strengthened by despair grappled the feet making stepping blocks of face and breast?
The living pressed on leaping, stumbling, staggering; their howl, "Gold--spoils--women--slaves," answered from the smoking hill, "_Christ and Holy Church._"

And now, the causeway crossed, the leading assailants gain the foot of the rough ascent.
No time to catch breath--none to look for advantage--none to profit by a glance at the preparation to receive them--up they must go, and up they went.
Arrows and javelins pierce them; stones crush them; the culverins spout fire in their faces, and, lifting them off their uncertain footing, hurl them bodily back upon the heads and shields of their comrades.
Along the brow of the rocky hill a mound of bodies arises wondrous quick, an obstacle to the warders of the pass who would shoot, and to the hordesmen a barrier.
Slowly the corona on the Scutarian hills deepened into dawn.
The Emperor joined Justiniani.
Count Corti came with him.
There was an affectionate greeting.
"Your Majesty, the day is scarcely full born, yet see how Islam is rueing it."
Constantine, following Justiniani's pointing, peered once through the smoke; then the necessity of the moment caught him, and, taking post between guns, he plied his long lance upon the wretches climbing the rising mound, some without shields, some weaponless, most of them incapable of combat.
With the brightening of day the mound grew in height and width, until at length the Christians sallied out upon it to meet the enemy still pouring on.
An hour thus.
Suddenly, seized with a comprehension of the futility of their effort, the hordesmen turned, and rushed from the hill and the causeway.
The Christians suffered but few casualties; yet they would have gladly rested.
Then, from the wall above the breach, whence he had used his bow, Count Corti descended hastily.
"Your Majesty," he said, his countenance kindled with enthusiasm, "the Janissaries are making ready."
Justiniani was prompt.
"Come!"
he shouted.
"Come every one!
We must have clear range for the guns.
Down with these dead!
Down with the living.
No time for pity!"
Setting the example, presently the defenders were tossing the bodies of their enemies down the face of the hill.
On his horse, by the great gun, Mahommed had observed the assault, listening while the night yet lingered.
Occasionally a courier rode to him with news from this Pacha or that one.
He heard without excitement, and returned invariably the same reply:

"Tell him to pour the hordes in."
At last an officer came at speed.
"Oh, my Lord, I salute you.
The city is won."
It was clear day then, yet a light not of the morning sparkled in Mahommed's eyes.
Stooping in his saddle, he asked: "What sayest thou?
Tell me of it, but beware--if thou speakest falsely, neither God nor Prophet shall save thee from impalement to the roots of thy tongue."
"As I have to tell my Lord what I saw with my own eyes, I am not afraid.... My Lord knows that where the palace of Blacherne begins on the south there is an angle in the wall.
There, while our people were feigning an assault to amuse the Greeks, they came upon a sunken gate"--

"The Cercoporta--I have heard of it."
"My Lord has the name.
Trying it, they found it unfastened and unguarded, and, pushing through a darkened passage, discovered they were in the Palace.
Mounting to the upper floor, they attacked the unbelievers.
The fighting goes on.
From room to room the Christians resist.
They are now cut off, and in a little time the quarter will be in our possession."
Mahommed spoke to Kalil: "Take this man, and keep him safely.
If he has spoken truly, great shall be his reward; if falsely, better he were not his mother's son."
Then to one of his household: "Come hither.... Go to the sunken gate Cercoporta, pass in, and find the chief now fighting in the palace of Blacherne.
Tell him I, Mahommed, require that he leave the Palace to such as may follow him, and march and attack the defenders of this gate, St. Romain, in the rear.
He shall not stop to plunder.
I give him one hour in which to do my bidding.
Ride thou now as if a falcon led thee.
For Allah and life!"
Next he called his Aga of Janissaries.
"Have the hordes before this gate retired.
They have served their turn; they have made the ditch passable, and the _Gabours_ are faint with killing them.
Observe, and when the road is cleared let go with the Flower of the Faithful.
A province to the first through; and this the battle-cry: _Allah-il-Allah!_ They will fight under my eye.
Minutes are worth kingdoms.
Go thou, and let go."
Always in reserve, always the last resort in doubtful battle, always the arm with which the Sultans struck the finishing blow, the Janissaries thus summoned to take up the assault were in discipline, spirit, and splendor of appearance the _elite_ corps of the martial world.
Riding to the front, the Aga halted to communicate Mahommed's orders.
Down the columns the speech was passed.
The Flower of the Faithful were in three divisions dismounted.
Throwing off their clumsy gowns, they stood forth in glittering mail, and shaking their brassy shields in air, shouted the old salute: "_Live the Padishah!
Live the Padishah!_"

The road to the gate was cleared; then the Aga galloped back, and when abreast of the yellow flag of the first division, he cried: "_Allah-il-Allah!_ Forward!"
And drum and trumpet breaking forth, a division moved down in column of fifties.
Slowly at first, but solidly, and with a vast stateliness it moved.
So at Pharsalia marched the legion Caesar loved--so in decision of heady fights strode the Old Guard of the world's last Conqueror.
Approaching the ditch, the fresh assailants set up the appointed battle-cry, and quickening the step to double time rushed over the terrible causeway.
Mahommed then descended to the ditch, and remained there mounted, the sword of Solomon in his hand, the mace of Ilderim at his saddle bow; and though hearing him was impossible, the Faithful took fire from his fire--enough that they were under his eye.
The feat attempted by the hordes was then repeated, except now there was order in disorder.
The machine, though shaken and disarranged, kept working on, working up.
Somehow its weight endured.
Slowly, with all its drench and cumber, the hill was surmounted.
Again a mound arose in front of the battery--again the sally, and the deadly ply of pikes from the top of the mound.
The Emperor's lance splintered; he fought with a pole-axe; still even he became sensible of a whelming pressure.
In the gorge, the smoke, loaded with lime-dust, dragged rather than lifted; no man saw down it to the causeway; yet the ascending din and clamor, possessed of the smiting power of a gust of wind, told of an endless array coming.
There was not time to take account of time; but at last a Turkish shield appeared over the ghastly rampart, glimmering as the moon glimmers through thick vapor.
Thrusts in scores were made at it, yet it arose; then a Janissary sprang up on the heap, singing like a muezzin, and shearing off the heads of pikes as reapers shear green rye.
He was a giant in stature and strength.
Both Genoese and Greeks were disposed to give him way.
The Emperor rallied them.
Still the Turk held his footing, and other Turks were climbing to his support.
Now it looked as if the crisis were come, now as if the breach were lost.
In the last second a cry _For Christ and Irene_ rang through the melee, and Count Corti, leaping from a gun, confronted the Turk.
"Ho, Son of Ouloubad!
Hassan, Hassan!"
[Footnote: One of the Janissaries, Hassan d'Ouloubad, of gigantic stature and prodigious strength, mounted to the assault under cover of his shield, his cimeter in the right hand.
He reached the rampart with thirty of his companions.
Nineteen of them were cast down, and Hassan himself fell struck by a stone.--VON HAMMER.]
he shouted, in the familiar tongue.
"Who calls me?"
the giant asked, lowering his shield, and gazing about in surprise.
"I call you--I, Mirza the Emir.
Thy time has come.
_Christ and Irene.
Now!_"

With the word the Count struck the Janissary fairly on the flat cap with his axe, bringing him to his knees.
Almost simultaneously a heavy stone descended upon the dazed man from a higher part of the wall, and he rolled backward down the steep.
Constantine and Justiniani, with others, joined the Count, but too late.
Of the fifty comrades composing Hassan's file, thirty mounted the rampart.
Eighteen of them were slain in the bout.
Corti raged like a lion; but up rushed the survivors of the next file--and the next--and the vantage-point was lost.
The Genoese, seeing it, said:

"Your Majesty, let us retire."
"Is it time?"
"We must get a ditch between us and this new horde, or we are all dead men."
Then the Emperor shouted: "Back, every one!
For love of Christ and Holy Church, back to the galley!"
The guns, machines, store of missiles, and space occupied by the battery were at once abandoned.
Constantine and Corti went last, facing the foe, who warily paused to see what they had next to encounter.
The secondary defence to which the Greeks resorted consisted of the hulk brought up, as we have seen, by Count Corti, planted on its keel squarely in rear of the breach, and filled with stones.
From the hulk, on right and left, wings of uncemented masonry extended to the main wall in form thus:

[Illustration]

A ditch fronted the line fifteen feet in width and twelve in depth, provided with movable planks for hasty passage.
Culverins were on the hulk, with ammunition in store.
Greatly to the relief of the jaded Christians, who, it is easy believing, stood not on the order of going, they beheld the reserves, under Demetrius Palaeologus and Nicholas Giudalli, in readiness behind the refuge.
The Emperor, on the deck, raised the visor of his helmet, and looked up at an Imperial flag drooping in the stagnant air from a stump of the mast.
Whatever his thought or feeling, no one could discern on his countenance an unbecoming expression.
The fact, of which he must have been aware, that this stand taken ended his empire forever, had not shaken his resolution or confidence.
To Demetrius Palaeologus, who had lent a hand helping him up the galley's side, he said: "Thank you, kinsman.
God may still be trusted.
Open fire."
The Janissaries, astonished at the new and strange defence, would have retreated, but could not; the files ascending behind drove them forward.
At the edge of the ditch the foremost of them made a despairing effort to resist the pressure rushing them to their fate--down they went in mass, in their last service no better than the hordesmen--clods they became--clods in bright harness instead of bull-hide and shaggy astrakhan.
From the wings, bolts and stones; from the height of the wall, bolts and stones; from the hulk, grapeshot; and the rattle upon the shields of the Faithful was as the passing of empty chariots over a Pompeiian street.
Imprecations, prayers, yells, groans, shrieks, had lodgement only in the ear of the Most Merciful.
The open maw of a ravenous monster swallowing the column fast as Mahommed down by the great moat drove it on--such was the new ditch.
Yet another, the final horror.
When the ditch was partially filled, the Christians brought jugs of the inflammable liquid contributed to the defence by John Grant; and cast them down on the writhing heap.
Straightway the trench became a pocket of flame, or rather an oven from which the smell of roasting human flesh issued along with a choking cloud!
The besieged were exultant, as they well might be--they were more than holding the redoubtable Flower of the Faithful at bay--there was even a merry tone in their battle-cry.
About that time a man dismounted from a foaming horse, climbed the rough steps to the deck of the galley, and delivered a message to the Emperor.
"Your Majesty.
John Grant, Minotle the bayle, Carystos, Langasco, and Jerome the Italian are slain.
Blacherne is in possession of the Turks, and they are marching this way.
The hordes are in the streets.
I saw them, and heard the bursting of doors, and the screams of women."
Constantine crossed himself three times, and bowed his head.
Justiniani turned the color of ashes, and exclaimed:

"We are undone--undone!
All is lost!"
And that his voice was hoarse did not prevent the words being overheard.
The fire slackened--ceased.
Men fighting jubilantly dropped their arms, and took up the cry--"All is lost!
The hordes are in, the hordes are in!"
Doubtless Count Corti's thought sped to the fair woman waiting for him in the chapel, yet he kept clear head.
"Your Majesty," he said, "my Berbers are without.
I will take them, and hold the Turks in check while you draw assistance from the walls.
Or"--he hesitated, "or I will defend your person to the ships.
It is not too late."
Indeed, there was ample time for the Emperor's escape.
The Berbers were keeping his horse with Corti's.
He had but to mount, and ride away.
No doubt he was tempted.
There is always some sweetness in life, especially to the blameless.
He raised his head, and said to Justiniani:

"Captain, my guard will remain here.
To keep the galley they have only to keep the fire alive in the ditch.
You and I will go out to meet the enemy."
... Then he addressed himself to Corti: "To horse, Count, and bring Theophilus Palaeologus.
He is on the wall between this gate and the gate Selimbria.... Ho, Christian gentlemen," he continued, to the soldiers closing around him, "all is not lost.
The Bochiardi at the Adrianople gate have not been heard from.
To fly from an unseen foe were shameful, We are still hundreds strong.
Let us descend, and form.
God cannot"--

That instant Justiniani uttered a loud cry, and dropped the axe he was holding.
An arrow had pierced the scales of his gauntlet, and disabled his hand.
The pain, doubtless, was great, and he started hastily as if to descend from the deck.
Constantine called out:

"Captain, Captain!"
"Give me leave, Your Majesty, to go and have this wound dressed."
"Where, Captain?"
"To my ship."
The Emperor threw his visor up--his face was flushed--in his soul indignation contended with astonishment.
"No, Captain, the wound cannot be serious; and besides, how canst thou get to thy ships?"
Justiniani looked over the bulwark of the vessel.
The alley from the gate ran on between houses abutting the towers.
A ball from one of Mahommed's largest guns had passed through the right-hand building, leaving a ragged fissure.
Thither the Captain now pointed.
"God opened that breach to let the Turks in.
I will go out by it."
He stayed no longer, but went down the steps, and in haste little short of a run disappeared through the fissure so like a breach.
The desertion was in view of his Genoese, of whom a few followed him, but not all.
Many who had been serving the guns took swords and pikes, and gathering about the Emperor, cried out:

"Give orders, Your Majesty.
We will bide with you."
He returned them a look full of gratitude.
"I thank you, gentlemen.
Let us go down, and join our shields across the street.
To my guard I commit defence of the galley."
Unfastening the purple half-cloak at his back, and taking off his helmet, he called to his sword-bearer: "Here, take thou these, and give me my sword.... Now, gallant gentlemen--now, my brave countrymen--we will put ourselves in the keeping of Heaven.
Come!"
They had not all gained the ground, however, when there arose a clamor in their front, and the hordesmen appeared, and blocking up the passage, opened upon them with arrows and stones, while such as had javelins and swords attacked them hand to hand.
The Christians behaved well, but none better than Constantine.
He fought with strength, and in good countenance; his blade quickly reddened to the hilt.
"Strike, my countrymen, for city and home.
Strike, every one, for _Christ and Holy Church!_"

And answering him: "_Christ and Holy Church!_" they all fought as they had strength, and their swords were also reddened to the hilt.
Quarter was not asked; neither was it given.
Theirs to hold the ground, and they held it.
They laid the hordesmen out over it in scattered heaps which grew, and presently became one long heap the width of the alley; and they too fell, but, as we are willing to believe, unconscious of pain because lapped in the delirium of battle-fever.
Five minutes--ten--fifteen--then through the breach by which Justiniani ingloriously fled Theophilus Palaeologus came with bared brand to vindicate his imperial blood by nobly dying; and with him came Count Corti, Francesco de Toledo, John the Dalmatian, and a score and more Christian gentlemen who well knew the difference between an honorable death and a dishonored life.
Steadily the sun arose.
Half the street was in its light, the other half in its shade; yet the struggle endured; nor could any man have said God was not with the Christians.
Suddenly a louder shouting arose behind them.
They who could, looked to see what it meant, and the bravest stood stone still at sight of the Janissaries swarming on the galley.
Over the roasting bodies of their comrades, undeterred by the inextinguishable fire, they had crossed the ditch, and were slaying the imperial body-guard.
A moment, and they would be in the alley, and then--

Up rose a wail: "The Janissaries, the Janissaries!
_Kyrie Eleison!_" Through the knot of Christians it passed--it reached Constantine in the forefront, and he gave way to the antagonist with whom he was engaged.
"God receive my soul!"
he exclaimed; and dropping his sword, he turned about, and rushed back with wide extended arms.
"Friends--countrymen!--Is there no Christian to kill me?"
Then they understood why he had left his helmet off.
While those nearest stared at him, their hearts too full of pity to do him the last favor one can ask of another, from the midst of the hordesmen there came a man of singular unfitness for such a scene--indeed a delicate woman had not been more out of place--for he was small, stooped, withered, very white haired, very pale, and much bearded--a black velvet cap on his head, and a gown of the like about his body, unarmed, and in every respect unmartial.
He seemed to glide in amongst the Christians as he had glided through the close press of the Turks; and as the latter had given him way, so now the sword points of the Christians went down--men in the heat of action forgot themselves, and became bystanders--such power was there in the unearthly eyes of the apparition.
"Is there no Christian to kill me?"
cried the Emperor again.
The man in velvet stood before him.
"Prince of India!"
"You know me?
It is well; for now I know you are not beyond remembering."
The voice was shrill and cutting, yet it shrilled and cut the sharper.
"Remember the day I called on you to acknowledge God, and give him his due of worship.
Remember the day I prayed you on my knees to lend me your power to save my child, stolen for a purpose by all peoples held unholy.
Behold your executioner!"
He stepped back, and raised a hand; and ere one of those standing by could so much as cry to God, Nilo, who, in the absorption of interest in his master, had followed him unnoticed--Nilo, gorgeous in his barbarisms of Kash-Cush, sprang into the master's place.
He did not strike; but with infinite cruel cunning of hand--no measurable lapse of time ensuing--drew the assegai across the face of the astonished Emperor.
Constantine--never great till that moment of death, but then great forever--fell forward upon his shield, calling in strangled utterance: "God receive my soul!"
The savage set his foot upon the mutilated countenance, crushing it into a pool of blood.
An instant, then through the petrified throng, knocking them right and left, Count Corti appeared.
"_For Christ and Irene!_" he shouted, dashing the spiked boss of his shield into Nilo's eyes--down upon the feathered coronal he brought his sword--and the negro fell sprawling upon the Emperor.
Oblivious to the surroundings, Count Corti, on his knees, raised the Emperor's head, slightly turning the face--one look was enough.
"His soul is sped!"
he said; and while he was tenderly replacing the head, a hand grasped his cap.
He sprang to his feet.
Woe to the intruder, if an enemy!
The sword which had known no failure was drawn back to thrust--above the advanced foot the shield hung in ready poise--between him and the challenger there was only a margin of air and the briefest interval of time--his breath was drawn, and his eyes gleamed with vengeful murder--but--some power invisible stayed his arm, and into his memory flashed the lightning of recognition.
"Prince of India," he shouted, "never wert thou nearer death!"
"Thou--liest!
Death--and--I"--

The words were long drawn between gasps, and the speech was never finished.
The tongue thickened, then paralyzed.
The features, already distorted with passion, swelled, and blackened horribly.
The eyes rolled back--the hands flew up, the fingers apart and rigid--the body rocked--stiffened--then fell, sliding from the Count's shield across the dead Emperor.
The combat meantime had gone on.
Corti, with a vague feeling that the Prince's flight of soul was a mystery in keeping with his life, took a second to observe him, and muttered: "Peace to him also!"
Looking about him then, he was made aware that the Christians, attacked in front and rear, were drawing together around the body of Constantine--that their resistance was become the last effort of brave men hopeless except of the fullest possible payment for their lives.
This was succeeded by a conviction of duty done on his part, and of every requirement of honor fulfilled; thereupon with a great throb of heart, his mind reverted to the Princess Irene waiting for him in the chapel.
He must go to her.
But how?
And was it not too late?
There are men whose wits are supernaturally quickened by danger.
The Count, pushing through the intervening throng, boldly presented himself to the Janissaries, shouting while warding the blows they aimed at him:

"Have done, O madmen!
See you not I am your comrade, Mirza the Emir?
Have done, I say, and let me pass.
I have a message for the Padishah!"
He spoke Turkish, and having been an idol in the barracks--their best swordsman--envied, and at the same time beloved--they knew him, and with acclamations opened their files, and let him pass.
By the fissure which had served Justiniani, he escaped from the terrible alley, and finding his Berbers and his horse, rode with speed for the residence of the Princess Irene.
Not a Christian survived the combat.
Greek, Genoese, Italian lay in ghastly composite with hordesmen and mailed Moslems around the Emperor.
In dying they had made good their battle-cry--_For Christ and Holy Church!_ Let us believe they will yet have their guerdon.
About an hour after the last of them had fallen, when the narrow passage was deserted by the living--the conquerors having moved on in search of their hire--the Prince of India aroused, and shook himself free of the corpses cumbering him.
Upon his knees he gazed at the dead--then at the place--then at the sky.
He rubbed his hands--made sure he was sound of person--he seemed uncertain, not of life, but of himself.
In fact, he was asking, Who am I?
And the question had reference to the novel sensations of which he was conscious.
What was it coursing through his veins?
Wine?--Elixir?--Some new principle which, hidden away amongst the stores of nature, had suddenly evolved for him?
The weights of age were gone.
In his body--bones, arms, limbs, muscles--he recognized once more the glorious impulses of youth; but his mind--he started--the ideas which had dominated him were beginning to return--and memory!
It surged back upon him, and into its wonted chambers, like a wave which, under pressure of a violent wind, has been momentarily driven from a familiar shore.
He saw, somewhat faintly at first, the events which had been promontories and lofty peaks cast up out of the level of his long existence.
Then THAT DAY and THAT EVENT!
How distinctly they reappeared to him!
They must be the same--must be--for he beheld the multitude on its way to Calvary, and the Victim tottering under the Cross; he heard the Tribune ask, "Ho, is this the street to Golgotha?"
He heard his own answer, "I will guide you;" and he spit upon the fainting Man of Sorrows, and struck him.
And then the words--"TARRY THOU TILL I COME!"
identified him to himself.
He looked at his hands--they were black with what had been some other man's life-blood, but under the stain the skin was smooth--a little water would make them white.
And what was that upon his breast?
Beard--beard black as a raven's wing!
He plucked a lock of hair from his head.
It, too, was thick with blood, but it was black.
Youth--youth--joyous, bounding, eager, hopeful youth was his once more!
He stood up, and there was no creak of rust in the hinges of his joints; he knew he was standing inches higher in the sunlit air; and a cry burst from him--"O God, I give thanks!"
The hymn stopped there, for between him and the sky, as if it were ascending transfigured, he beheld the Victim of the Crucifixion; and the eyes, no longer sad, but full of accusing majesty, were looking downward at him, and the lips were in speech: "TARRY THOU TILL I COME!"
He covered his face with his hands.
Yes, yes, he had his youth back again, but it was with the old mind and nature--youth, that the curse upon him might, in the mortal sense, be eternal!
And pulling his black hair with his young hands, wrenching at his black beard, it was given him to see he had undergone his fourteenth transformation, and that between this one and the last there was no lapse of connection.
Old age had passed, leaving the conditions and circumstances of its going to the youth which succeeded.
The new life in starting picked up and loaded itself with every burden and all the misery of the old.
So now while burrowing, as it were, amongst dead men, his head upon the breast of the Emperor whom, treating Nilo as an instrument in his grip, he had slain, he thought most humanly of the effects of the transformation.
First of all, his personal identity was lost, and he was once more a Wanderer without an acquaintance, a friend, or a sympathizer on the earth.
To whom could he now address himself with a hope of recognition?
His heart went out primarily to Lael--he loved her.
Suppose he found her, and offered to take her in his arms; she would repulse him.
"Thou art not my father.
He was old--thou art young."
And Syama, whose bereavements of sense had recommended him for confidant in the event of his witnessing the dreaded circumstance just befallen--if he addressed himself to Syama, the faithful creature would deny him.
"No; my master was old--his hair and beard were white--thou art a youth.
Go hence."
And then Mahommed, to whom he had been so useful in bringing additional empire, and a glory which time would make its own forever--did he seek Mahommed again--"Thou art not the Prince of India, my peerless Messenger of the Stars.
He was old--his hair and beard were white--thou art a boy.
Ho, guards, take this impostor, and do with him as ye did with Balta-Ogli stretch him on the ground, and beat the breath out of him."
There is nothing comes to us, whether in childhood or age, so crushing as a sense of isolation.
Who will deny it had to do with the marshalling of worlds, and the peopling them--with creation?
These reflections did but wait upon the impulse which still further identified him to himself--the impulse to go and keep going--and he cast about for solaces.
"It is the Judgment," he said, with a grim smile; "but my stores remain, and Hiram of Tyre is yet my friend.
I have my experience of more than a thousand years, and with it youth again.
I cannot make men better, and God refuses my services.
Nevertheless I will devise new opportunities.
The earth is round, and upon its other side there must be another world.
Perhaps I can find some daring spirit equal to the voyage and discovery--some one Heaven may be more willing to favor.
But this meeting place of the old continents"--he looked around him, and then to the sky--"with my farewell, I leave it the curse of the most accursed.
The desired of nations, it shall be a trouble to them forever."
Then he saw Nilo under a load of corpses, and touched by remembrance of the poor savage's devotion, he uncovered him to get at his heart, which was still beating.
Next he threw away his cap and gown, replaced them with a bloody tarbousche and a shaggy Angora mantle, selected a javelin, and sauntered leisurely on into the city.
Having seen Constantinople pillaged by Christians, he was curious to see it now sacked by Moslems--there might be a further solace in the comparison.
[Footnote: According to the earliest legends, the Wandering Jew was about thirty years old when he stood in the road to Golgotha, and struck the Saviour, and ordered him to go forward.
At the end of every hundred years, the undying man falls into a trance, during which his body returns to the age it was when the curse was pronounced.
In all other respects he remains unchanged.]
CHAPTER XIII

MAHOMMED IN SANCTA SOPHIA

Count Corti, we may well believe, did not spare his own steed, or those of his Berbers; and there was a need of haste of which he was not aware upon setting out from St. Romain.
The Turks had broken through the resistance of the Christian fleet in the harbor, and were surging into the city by the gate St. Peter (Phanar), which was perilously near the residence of the Princess Irene.
Already the spoil-seekers were making sure of their hire.
More than once he dashed by groups of them hurrying along the streets in search of houses most likely to repay plundering.
There were instances when he overtook hordesmen already happy in the possession of "strings of slaves;" that is to say, of Greeks, mostly women and children, tied by their hands to ropes, and driven mercilessly on.
The wailing and prayers of the unfortunate smote the Count to the heart; he longed to deliver them; but he had given his best efforts to save them in the struggle to save the city, and had failed; now it would be a providence of Heaven could he rescue the woman waiting for him in such faith as was due his word and honor specially plighted to her.
As the pillagers showed no disposition to interfere with him, he closed his eyes and ears to their brutalities, and sped forward.
The district in which the Princess dwelt was being overrun when he at last drew rein at her door.
With a horrible dread, he alighted, and pushed in unceremoniously.
The reception-room was empty.
Was he too late?
Or was she then in Sancta Sophia?
He flew to the chapel, and blessed God and Christ and the Mother, all in a breath.
She was before the altar in the midst of her attendants.
Sergius stood at her side, and of the company they alone were perfectly self-possessed.
A white veil lay fallen over her shoulders; save that, she was in unrelieved black.
The pallor of her countenance, caused, doubtless, by weeks of care and unrest, detracted slightly from the marvelous beauty which was hers by nature; but it seemed sorrow and danger only increased the gentle dignity always observable in her speech and manner.
"Princess Irene," he said, hastening forward, and reverently saluting her hand, "if you are still of the mind to seek refuge in Sancta Sophia, I pray you, let us go thither."
"We are ready," she returned.
"But tell me of the Emperor."
The Count bent very low.
"Your kinsman is beyond insult and further humiliation.
His soul is with God."
Her eyes glistened with tears, and partly to conceal her emotion she turned to the picture above the altar, and said, in a low voice, and brokenly:

"O Holy Mother, have thou his soul in thy tender care, and be with me now, going to what fate I know not."
The young women surrounded her, and on their knees filled the chapel with sobbing and suppressed wails.
Striving for composure himself, the Count observed them, and was at once assailed by an embarrassment.
They were twenty and more.
Each had a veil over her head; yet from the delicacy of their hands he could imagine their faces, while their rank was all too plainly certified by the elegance of their garments.
As a temptation to the savages, their like was not within the walls.
How was he to get them safely to the Church, and defend them there?
He was used to military problems, and decision was a habit with him; still he was sorely tried--indeed, he was never so perplexed.
The Princess finished her invocation to the Holy Mother.
"Count Corti," she said, "I now place myself and these, my sisters in misfortune, under thy knightly care.
Only suffer me to send for one other.--Go, Sergius, and bring Lael."
One other!
"Now God help me!"
he cried, involuntarily; and it seemed he was heard.
"Princess," he returned, "the Turks have possession of the streets.
On my way I passed them with prisoners whom they were driving, and they appeared to respect a right of property acquired.
Perhaps they will be not less observant to me; wherefore bring other veils here--enough to bind these ladies two and two."
As she seemed hesitant, he added: "Pardon me, but in the streets you must all go afoot, to appearances captives just taken."
The veils were speedily produced, and the Princess bound her trembling companions in couples hand to hand; submitting finally to be herself tied to Lael.
Then when Sergius was more substantially joined to the ancient Lysander, the household sallied forth.
A keener realization of the situation seized the gentler portion of the procession once they were in the street, and they there gave way to tears, sobs, and loud appeals to the Saints and Angels of Mercy.
The Count rode in front; four of his Berbers moved on each side; Sheik Hadifah guarded the rear; and altogether a more disconsolate company of captives it were hard imagining.
A rope passing from the first couple to the last was the only want required to perfect the resemblance to the actual slave droves at the moment on nearly every thoroughfare in Constantinople.
The weeping cortege passed bands of pillagers repeatedly.
Once what may be termed a string in fact was met going in the opposite direction; women and children, and men and women were lashed together, like animals, and their lamentations were piteous.
If they fell or faltered, they were beaten.
It seemed barbarity could go no further.
Once the Count was halted.
A man of rank, with a following at his heels, congratulated him in Turkish:

"O friend, thou hast a goodly capture."
The stranger came nearer.
"I will give you twenty gold pieces for this one," pointing to the Princess Irene, who, fortunately, could not understand him--"and fifteen for this one."
"Go thy way, and quickly," said Corti, sternly.
"Dost thou threaten me?"
"By the Prophet, yes--with my sword, and the Padishah."
"The Padishah!
Oh, ho!"
and the man turned pale.
"God is great--I give him praise."
At last the Count alighted before the main entrance of the Church.
By friendly chance, also--probably because the site was far down toward the sea, in a district not yet reached by the hordesmen--the space in front of the vestibule was clear of all but incoming fugitives; and he had but to knock at the door, and give the name of the Princess Irene to gain admission.
In the vestibule the party were relieved of their bonds; after which they passed into the body of the building, where they embraced each other, and gave praise aloud for what they considered a final deliverance from death and danger; in their transports, they kissed the marbles of the floor again and again.
While this affecting scene was going on, Corti surveyed the interior.
The freest pen cannot do more than give the view with a clearness to barely stimulate the reader's imagination.
It was about eleven o'clock.
The smoke of battle which had overlain the hills of the city was dissipated; so the sun, nearing high noon, poured its full of splendor across the vast nave in rays slanted from south to north, and a fine, almost impalpable dust hanging from the dome in the still air, each ray shone through it in vivid, half-prismatic relief against the shadowy parts of the structure.
Such pillars in the galleries as stood in the paths of the sunbeams seemed effulgent, like emeralds and rubies.
His eyes, however, refused everything except the congregation of people.
"O Heaven!"
he exclaimed.
"What is to become of these poor souls!"
Byzantium, it must be recalled, had had its triumphal days, when Greeks drew together, like Jews on certain of their holy occasions; undoubtedly the assemblages then were more numerous, but never had there been one so marked by circumstances.
This was the funeral day of the Empire!
Let the reader try to recompose the congregation the Count beheld--civilians--soldiers--nuns--monks--monks bearded, monks shaven, monks tonsured--monks in high hats and loose veils, monks in gowns scarce distinguishable from gowns of women--monks by the thousand.
Ah, had they but dared a manly part on the walls, the cause of the Christ for whom they affected such devotion would not have suffered the humiliation to which it was now going!
As to the mass in general, let the reader think of the rich jostled by the poor--fine ladies careless if their robes took taint from the Lazarus' next them--servants for once at least on a plane with haughty masters--Senators and slaves--grandsires--mothers with their infants--old and young, high and low, all in promiscuous presence--society at an end--Sancta Sophia a universal last refuge.
And by no means least strange, let the reader fancy the refugees on their knees, silent as ghosts in a tomb, except that now and then the wail of a child broke the awful hush, and gazing over their shoulders, not at the altar, but toward the doors of entrance; then let him understand that every one in the smother of assemblage--every one capable of thought--was in momentary expectation of a miracle.
Here and there moved priestly figures, holding crucifixes aloft, and halting at times to exhort in low voices: "Be not troubled, O dearly beloved of Christ!
The angel will appear by the old column.
If the powers of hell are not to prevail against the Church, what may men do against the sword of God?"
The congregation was waiting for the promised angel to rescue them from the Barbarians.
Of opinion that the chancel, or space within the railing of the apse opposite him, was a better position for his charge than the crowded auditorium, partly because he could more easily defend them there, and partly because Mahommed when he arrived would naturally look for the Princess near the altar, the Count, with some trouble, secured a place within it behind the brazen balustrade at the right of the gate.
The invasion of the holy reserve by the Berbers was viewed askance, but submitted to; thereupon the Princess and her suite took to waiting and praying.
Afterwhile the doors in the east were barred by the janitor.
Still later there was knocking at them loud enough to be by authority.
The janitor had become deaf.
Later still a yelling as of a mob out in the vestibule penetrated to the interior, and a shiver struck the expectant throng, less from a presentiment of evil at hand than a horrible doubt.
An angel of the Lord would hardly adopt such an incongruous method of proclaiming the miracle done.
A murmur of invocation began with those nearest the entrances, and ran from the floor to the galleries.
As it spread, the shouting increased in volume and temper.
Ere long the doors were assailed.
The noise of a blow given with determination rang dreadful warning through the whole building, and the concourse arose.
The women shrieked: "The Turks!
The Turks!"
Even the nuns who had been practising faith for years joined their lay sisters in crying: "The Turks!
The Turks!"
The great, gowned, cowardly monks dropped their crucifixes, and, like the commoner sons of the Church, howled: "The Turks!
The Turks!"
Finally the doors were battered in, and sure enough--there stood the hordesmen, armed and panoplied each according to his tribe or personal preference--each a most unlikely delivering angel.
This completed the panic.
In the vicinity of the ruined doors everybody, overcome by terror, threw himself upon those behind, and the impulsion thus started gained force while sweeping on.
As ever in such cases, the weak were the sufferers.
Children were overrun--infants dashed from the arms of mothers--men had need of their utmost strength--and the wisdom of the Count in seeking the chancel was proved.
The massive brazen railing hardly endured the pressure when the surge reached it; but it stood, and the Princess and her household--all, in fact, within the chancel--escaped the crushing, but not the horror.
The spoilsmen were in strength, but they were prudently slow in persuading themselves that the Greeks were unarmed, and incapable of defending the Church.
Ere long they streamed in, and for the first time in the history of the edifice the colossal Christ on the ceiling above the altar was affronted by the slogan of Islam--_Allah-il-Allah_.
Strange now as it may appear to the reader, there is no mention in the chronicles of a life lost that day within the walls of Sancta Sophia.
The victors were there for plunder, not vengeance, and believing there was more profit in slaves than any other kind of property, their effort was to save rather than kill.
The scene was beyond peradventure one of the cruelest in history, but the cruelty was altogether in taking possession of captives.
Tossing their arms of whatever kind upon their backs, the savages pushed into the pack of Christians to select whom they would have.
We may be sure the old, sick, weakly, crippled, and very young were discarded, and the strong and vigorous chosen.
Remembering also how almost universally the hordes were from the East, we may be sure a woman was preferred to a man, and a pretty woman to an ugly one.
The hand shrinks from trying to depict the agonies of separation which ensued--mothers torn from their children, wives from husbands--their shrieks, entreaties, despair--the mirthful brutality with which their pitiful attempts at resistance were met--the binding and dragging away--the last clutch of love--the final disappearance.
It is only needful to add that the rapine involved the galleries no less than the floor.
All things considered, the marvel is that the cry--there was but one, just as the sounds of many waters are but one to the ear--which then tore the habitual silence of the august temple should have ever ceased--and it would not if, in its duration, human sympathy were less like a flitting echo.
Next to women, the monks were preferred, and the treatment they received was not without its touches of grim humor.
Their cowls were snatched off, and bandied about, their hats crushed over their ears, their veils stuffed in their mouths to stifle their outcries, their rosaries converted into scourges; and the laughter when a string of them passed to the doors was long and loud.
They had pulled their monasteries down upon themselves.
If the Emperor, then lying in the bloody alley of St. Romain, dead through their bigotry, superstition, and cowardice, had been vengeful in the slightest degree, a knowledge of the judgment come upon them so soon would have been at least restful to his spirit.
It must not be supposed Count Corti was indifferent while this appalling scene was in progress.
The chancel, he foresaw, could not escape the foray.
There was the altar, loaded with donatives in gold and precious stones, a blazing pyramidal invitation.
When the doors were burst in, he paused a moment to see if Mahommed were coming.
"The hordes are here, O Princess, but not the Sultan."
She raised her veil, and regarded him silently.
"I see now but one resort.
As Mirza the Emir, I must meet the pillagers by claiming the Sultan sent me in advance to capture and guard you for him."
"We are at mercy, Count Corti," she replied.
"Heaven deal with you as you deal with us."
"If the ruse fails, Princess, I can die for you.
Now tie yourselves as before--two and two, hand to hand.
It may be they will call on me to distinguish such as are my charge."
She cast a glance of pity about her.
"And these, Count--these poor women not of my house, and the children--can you not save them also?"
"Alas, dear lady!
The Blessed Mother must be their shield."
While the veils were being applied, the surge against the railing took place, leaving a number of dead and fainting across it.
"Hadifah," the Count called out, "clear the way to yon chair against the wall."
The Sheik set about removing the persons blockading the space, and greatly affected by their condition, the Princess interceded for them.
"Nay, Count, disturb them not.
Add not to their terror, I pray."
But the Count was a soldier; in case of an affray, he wanted the advantage of a wall at his back.
"Dear lady, it was the throne of your fathers, now yours.
I will seat you there.
From it you can best treat with the Lord Mahommed."
Ere long some of the hordes--half a dozen or more--came to the chancel gate.
They were of the rudest class of Anatolian shepherds, clad principally in half-cloaks of shaggy goat skin.
Each bore at his back a round buckler, a bow, and a clumsy quiver of feathered arrows.
Awed by the splendor of the altar and its surroundings, they stopped; then, with shouts, they rushed at the tempting display, unmindful of the living spoils crouched on the floor dumb with terror.
Others of a like kind reenforced them, and there was a fierce scramble.
The latest comers turned to the women, and presently discovered the Princess Irene sitting upon the throne.
One, more eager than the rest, was indisposed to respect the Berbers.
"Here are slaves worth having.
Get your ropes," he shouted to his companions.
The Count interposed.
"Art thou a believer?"
he asked in Turkish.
They surveyed him doubtfully, and then turned to Hadifah and his men, tall, imperturbable looking, their dark faces visible through their open hoods of steel.
They looked at their shields also, and at their bare cimeters resting points to the floor.
"Why do you ask?"
the man returned.
"Because, as thou mayst see, we also are of the Faithful, and do not wish harm to any whose mothers have taught them to begin the day with the Fah-hat."
The fellow was impressed.
"Who art thou?"
"I am the Emir Mirza, of the household of our Lord the Padishah--to whom be all the promises of the Koran!
These are slaves I selected for him--all these thou seest in bonds.
I am keeping them till he arrives.
He will be here directly.
He is now coming."
A man wearing a bloody tarbousche joined the pillagers, during this colloquy, and pressing in, heard the Emir's name passing from mouth to mouth.
"The Emir Mirza!
I knew him, brethren.
He commanded the caravan, and kept the _mahmals,_ the year I made the pilgrimage....
Stand off, and let me see."
After a short inspection, he continued: "Truly as there is no God but God, this is he.
I was next him at the most holy corner of the Kaaba when he fell down struck by the plague.
I saw him kiss the Black Stone, and by virtue of the kiss he lived.... Ay, stand back--or if you touch him, or one of these in his charge, and escape his hand, ye shall not escape the Padishah, whose first sword he is, even as Khalid was first sword for the Prophet--exalted be his name!...
Give me thy hand, O valiant Emir."
He kissed the Count's hand.
"Arise, O son of thy father," said Corti; "and when our master, the Lord Mahommed, hath set up his court and harem, seek me for reward."
The man stayed awhile, although there was no further show of interference; and he looked past the Princess to Lael cowering near her.
He took no interest in what was going on around him--Lael alone attracted him.
At last he shifted his sheepskin covering higher upon his shoulders, and left these words with the Count:

"The women are not for the harem.
I understand thee, O Mirza.
When the Lord Mahommed hath set up his court, do thou tell the little Jewess yonder that her father the Prince of India charged thee to give her his undying love."
Count Corti was wonder struck--he could not speak--and so the Wandering Jew vanished from his sight as he now vanishes from our story.
The selection among the other refugees in the chancel proceeded until there was left of them only such as were considered not worth the having.
A long time passed, during which the Princess Irene sat with veil drawn close, trying to shut out the horror of the scene.
Her attendants, clinging to the throne and to each other, seemed a heap of dead women.
At last a crash of music was heard in the vestibule--drums, cymbals, and trumpets in blatant flourish.
Four runners, slender lads, in short, sleeveless jackets over white shirts, and wide trousers of yellow silk, barefooted and bareheaded, stepped lightly through the central doorway, and, waving wands tipped with silver balls, cried, in long-toned shrill iteration: "The Lord Mahommed--Mahommed, Sultan of Sultans."
The spoilsmen suspended their hideous labor--the victims, moved doubtless by a hope of rescue, gave over their lamentations and struggling--only the young children, and the wounded, and suffering persisted in vexing the floor and galleries.
Next to enter were the five official heralds.
Halting, they blew a triumphant refrain, at which the thousands of eyes not too blinded by misery turned to them.
And Mahommed appeared!
He too had escaped the Angel of the false monks!
When the fighting ceased in the harbor, and report assured him of the city at mercy, Mahommed gave order to make the Gate St. Romain passable for horsemen, and with clever diplomacy summoned the Pachas and other military chiefs to his tent; it was his pleasure that they should assist him in taking possession of the prize to which he had been helped by their valor.
With a rout so constituted at his back, and an escort of _Silihdars_ mounted, the runners and musicians preceding him, he made his triumphal entry into Constantinople, traversing the ruins of the towers Bagdad and St. Romain.
He was impatient and restless.
In their ignorance of his passion for the Grecian Princess, his ministers excused his behavior on account of his youth [Footnote: He was in his twenty-third year.]
and the greatness of his achievement.
Passing St. Romain, it was also observed he took no interest in the relics of combat still there.
He gave his guides but one order:

"Take me to the house the _Gabours_ call the Glory of God."
"Sancta Sophia, my Lord?"
"Sancta Sophia--and bid the runners run."
His Sheik-ul-Islam was pleased.
"Hear!"
he said to the dervishes with him.
"The Lord Mahommed will make mosques of the houses of Christ before sitting down in one of the palaces.
His first honors are to God and the Prophet."
And they dutifully responded: "Great are God and his Prophet!
Great is Mahommed, who conquers in their names!"
The public edifices by which he was guided--churches, palaces, and especially the high aqueduct, excited his admiration; but he did not slacken the fast trot in which he carried his loud cavalcade past them until at the Hippodrome.
"What thing of devilish craft is here?"
he exclaimed, stopping in front of the Twisted Serpents.
"Thus the Prophet bids me!"
and with a blow of his mace, he struck off the lower jaw of one of the Pythons.
Again the dervishes shouted: "Great is Mahommed, the servant of God!"
It was his preference to be taken to the eastern front of Sancta Sophia, and in going the guides led him by the corner of the Bucoleon.
At sight of the vast buildings, their incomparable colonnades and cornices, their domeless stretches of marble and porphyry, he halted the second time, and in thought of the vanity of human glory, recited:

"The spider hath woven his web in the imperial palace;     And the owl hath sung her watch-song on the towers of       Afrasiab."
In the space before the Church, as elsewhere along the route he had come, the hordes were busy carrying off their wretched captives; but he affected not to see them.
They had bought the license of him, many of them with their blood.
At the door the suite dismounted.
Mahommed however, kept his saddle while surveying the gloomy exterior.
Presently he bade:

"Let the runners and the heralds enter."
Hardly were they gone in, when he spoke to one of his pages: "Here, take thou this, and give me my cimeter."
And then, receiving the ruby-hilted sword of Solomon in exchange for the mace of Ilderim, without more ado he spurred his horse up the few broad stone steps, and into the vestibule.
Thence, the contemptuous impulse yet possessing him, he said loudly: "The house is defiled with idolatrous images.
Islam is in the saddle."
In such manner--mounted, sword in hand, shield behind him--clad in beautiful gold-washed chain mail, the very ideal of the immortal Emir who won Jerusalem from the Crusaders, and restored it to Allah and the Prophet--Mahommed made his first appearance in Sancta Sophia.
Astonishment seized him.
He checked his horse.
Slowly his gaze ranged over the floor--up to the galleries--up--up to the swinging dome--in all architecture nothing so nearly a self-depending sky.
"Here, take the sword--give me back my mace," he said.
And in a fit of enthusiasm, not seeing, not caring for the screaming wretches under hoof, he rode forward, and, standing at full height in his stirrups, shouted: "Idolatry be done!
Down with the Trinity.
Let Christ give way for the last and greatest of the Prophets!
To God the one God, I dedicate this house!"
Therewith he dashed the mace against a pillar; and as the steel rebounded, the pillar trembled.
[Footnote: The guides, if good Moslems, take great pleasure in showing tourists the considerable dent left by this blow in the face of the pillar.]
"Now give me the sword again, and call Achmet, my muezzin--Achmet with the flute in his throat."
The moods of Mahommed were swift going and coming.
Riding out a few steps, he again halted to give the floor a look.
This time evidently the house was not in his mind.
The expression on his face became anxious.
He was searching for some one, and moved forward so slowly the people could get out of his way, and his suite overtake him.
At length he observed the half-stripped altar in the apse, and went to it.
The colossal Christ on the ceiling peered down on him through the shades beginning to faintly fill the whole west end.
Now he neared the brazen railing of the chancel--now he was at the gate--his countenance changed--his eyes brightened--he had discovered Count Corti.
Swinging lightly from his saddle, he passed with steps of glad impatience through the gateway.
Then to Count Corti came the most consuming trial of his adventurous life.
The light was still strong enough to enable him to see across the Church.
Comprehending the flourish of the heralds, he saw the man on horseback enter; and the mien, the pose in the saddle, the rider's whole outward expose of spirit, informed him with such certainty as follows long and familiar association, that Mahommed was come--Mahommed, his ideal of romantic orientalism in arms.
A tremor shook him--his cheek whitened.
To that moment anxiety for the Princess had held him so entirely he had not once thought of the consequences of the wager lost; now they were let loose upon him.
Having saved her from the hordes, now he must surrender her to a rival--now she was to go from him forever.
Verily it had been easier parting with his soul.
He held to his cimeter as men instantly slain sometimes keep grip on their weapons; yet his head sunk upon his breast, and he saw nothing more of Mahommed until he stood before him inside the chancel.
"Count Corti, where is"--

Mahommed caught sight of the Count's face.
"Oh, my poor Mirza!"
A volume of words could not have so delicately expressed sympathy as did that altered tone.
Taking off his steel glove, the fitful Conqueror extended the bare hand, and the Count, partially recalled to the situation by the gracious offer, sunk to his knees, and carried the hand to his lips.
"I have kept the faith, my Lord," he said in Turkish, his voice scarcely audible.
"This is she behind me--upon the throne of her fathers.
Receive her from me, and let me depart."
"My poor Mirza!
We left the decision to God, and he has decided.
Arise, and hear me now."
To the notables closing around, he said, imperiously: "Stand not back.
Come up, and hear me."
Stepping past the Count, then, he stood before the Princess.
She arose without removing her veil, and would have knelt; but Mahommed moved nearer, and prevented her.
The training of the politest court in Europe was in her action, and the suite looking on, used to slavishness in captives, and tearful humility in women, he held her with amazement; nor could one of them have said which most attracted him, her queenly composure or her simple grace.
"Suffer me, my Lord," she said to him; then to her attendants: "This is Mahommed the Sultan.
Let us pray him for honorable treatment."
Presently they were kneeling, and she would have joined them, but Mahommed again interfered.
"Your hand, O Princess Irene!
I wish to salute it."
Sometimes a wind blows out of the sky, and swinging the bell in the cupola, starts it to ringing itself; so now, at sight of the only woman he ever really loved overtaken by so many misfortunes, and actually threatened by a rabble of howling slave-hunters, Mahommed's better nature thrilled with pity and remorse, and it was only by an effort of will he refrained from kneeling to her, and giving his passion tongue.
Nevertheless a kiss, though on the hand, can be made tell a tale of love, and that was what the youthful Conqueror did.
"I pray next that you resume your seat," he continued.
"It has pleased God, O daughter of a Palaeologus, to leave you the head of the Greek people; and as I have the terms of a treaty to submit of great concern to them and you, it were more becoming did you hear me from a throne.... And first, in this presence, I declare you a free woman--free to go or stay, to reject or to accept--for a treaty is impossible except to sovereigns.
If it be your pleasure to go, I pledge conveyance, whether by sea or land, to you and yours--attendants, slaves, and property; nor shall there be in any event a failure of moneys to keep you in the state to which you have been used."
"For your grace, Lord Mahommed, I shall beseech Heaven to reward you."
"As the God of your faith is the God of mine, O Princess Irene, I shall be grateful for your prayers....
In the next place, I entreat you to abide here; and to this I am moved by regard for your happiness.
The conditions will be strange to you, and in your going about there will be much to excite comparisons of the old with the new; but the Arabs had once a wise man, El Hatim by name--you may have heard of him"--he cast a quick look at the eyes behind the veil--"El Hatim, a poet, a warrior, a physician, and he left a saying: 'Herbs for fevers, amulets for mischances, and occupation for distempers of memory.'
If it should be that time proves powerless over your sorrows, I would bring employment to its aid....
Heed me now right well.
It pains me to think of Constantinople without inhabitants or commerce, its splendors decaying, its palaces given over to owls, its harbor void of ships, its churches vacant except of spiders, its hills desolations to eyes afar on the sea.
If it become not once more the capital city of Europe and Asia, some one shall have defeated the will of God; and I cannot endure that guilt or the thought of it.
'Sins are many in kind and degree, differing as the leaves and grasses differ,' says a dervish of my people; 'but for him who stands wilfully in the eyes of the Most Merciful--for him only shall there be no mercy in the Great Day.'...
Yes, heed me right well--I am not the enemy of the Greeks, O Princess Irene.
Their power could not agree with mine, and I made war upon it; but now that Heaven has decided the issue, I wish to recall them.
They will not listen to me.
Though I call loudly and often, they will remember the violence inflicted on them in my name.
Their restoration is a noble work in promise.
Is there a Greek of trust, and so truly a lover of his race, to help me make the promise a deed done?
The man is not; but thou, O Princess--thou art.
Behold the employment I offer you!
I will commission you to bring them home--even these sorrowful creatures going hence in bonds.
Or do you not love them so much?...
Religion shall not hinder you.
In the presence of these, my ministers of state, I swear to divide houses of God with you; half of them shall be Christian, the other half Moslem; arid neither sect shall interfere with the other's worship.
This I will seal, reserving only this house, and that the Patriarch be chosen subject to my approval.
Or do you not love your religion so much?"....
During the discourse the Princess listened intently; now she would have spoken, but he lifted his hand.
"Not yet, not yet!
it is not well for you to answer now.
I desire that you have time to consider--and besides, I come to terms of more immediate concern to you....
Here, in the presence of these witnesses, O Princess Irene, I offer you honorable marriage."
Mahommed bowed very low at the conclusion of this proposal.
"And wishing the union in conscience agreeable to you, I undertake to celebrate it according to Christian rite and Moslem.
So shall you become Queen of the Greeks--their intercessor--the restorer and protector of their Church and worship--so shall you be placed in a way to serve God purely and unselfishly; and if a thirst for glory has ever moved you, O Princess, I present it to you a cupful larger than woman ever drank.... You may reside here or in Therapia, and keep your private chapel and altar, and choose whom you will to serve them.
And these things I will also swear to and seal."
Again she would have interrupted him.
"No--bear with me for the once.
I invoke your patience," he said.
"In the making of treaties, O Princess, one of the parties must first propose terms; then it is for the other to accept or reject, and in turn propose.
And this"--he glanced hurriedly around--"this is no time nor place for argument.
Be content rather to return to your home in the city or your country-house at Therapia.
In three days, with your permission, I will come for your answer; and whatever it be, I swear by Him who is God of the world, it shall be respected....
When I come, will you receive me?"
"The Lord Mahommed will be welcome."
"Where may I wait on you?"
"At Therapia," she answered.
Mahommed turned about then.
"Count Corti, go thou with the Princess Irene to Therapia.
I know thou wilt keep her safely.--And thou, Kalil, have a galley suitable for a Queen of the Greeks made ready on the instant, and let there be no lack of guards despatched with it, subject to the orders of Count Corti, for the time once more Mirza the Emir.... O Princess, if I have been peremptory, forgive me, and lend me thy hand again.
I wish to salute it."
Again she silently yielded to his request.
Kalil, seeing only politics in the scene, marched before the Princess clearing the way, and directly she was out of the Church.
At the suggestion of the Count, sedan chairs were brought, and she and her half-stupefied companions carried to a galley, arriving at Therapia about the fourth hour after sunset.
Mahommed had indeed been imperious in the interview; but, as he afterward explained to her, with many humble protestations, he had a part to play before his ministers.
No sooner was she removed than he gave orders to clear the building of people and idolatrous symbols; and while the work was in progress, he made a tour of inspection going from the floor to the galleries.
His wonder and admiration were unbounded.
Passing along the right-hand gallery, he overtook a pilferer with a tarbousche full of glass cubes picked from one of the mosaic pictures.
"Thou despicable!"
he cried, in rage.
"Knowest thou not that I have devoted this house to Allah?
Profane a Mosque, wilt thou?"
And he struck the wretch with the flat of his sword.
Hastening then to the chancel, he summoned Achmet, the muezzin.
"What is the hour?"
he asked.
"It is the hour of the fourth prayer, my Lord."
"Ascend thou then to the highest turret of the house, and call the Faithful to pious acknowledgment of the favors of God and his Prophet--may their names be forever exalted."
Thus Sancta Sophia passed from Christ to Mahomet; and from that hour to this Islam has had sway within its walls.
Not once since have its echoes been permitted to respond to a Christian prayer or a hymn to the Virgin.
Nor was this the first instance when, to adequately punish a people for the debasement and perversions of his revelations, God, in righteous anger, tolerated their destruction.
To-day there are two cities, lights once of the whole earth, under curses so deeply graven in their remains--sites, walls, ruins--that every man and woman visiting them should be brought to know why they fell.
Alas, for Jerusalem!
Alas, for Constantinople!
POSTSCRIPTS.
In the morning of the third day after the fall of the city, a common carrier galley drew alongside the marble quay in front of the Princess' garden at Therapia, and landed a passenger--an old, decrepit man, cowled and gowned like a monk.
With tottering steps he passed the gate, and on to the portico of the classic palace.
Of Lysander, he asked: "Is the Princess Irene here or in the city?"
"She is here."
"I am a Greek, tired and hungry.
Will she see me?"
The ancient doorkeeper disappeared, but soon returned.
"She will see you.
This way."
The stranger was ushered into the reception room.
Standing before the Princess, he threw back his cowl.
She gazed at him a moment, then went to him and, taking his hands, cried, her eyes streaming with tears: "Father Hilarion!
Now praised be God for sending you to me in this hour of uncertainty and affliction!"
Needless saying the poor man's trials ended there, and that he never again went cold, or hungry, or in want of a place to lay his head.
But this morning, after breaking fast, he was taken into council, and the proposal of marriage being submitted to him, he asked first:

"What are thy inclinations, daughter?"
And she made unreserved confession.
The aged priest spread his hands paternally over her head, and, looking upward, said solemnly: "I think I see the Great Designer's purpose.
He gave thee, O daughter, thy beauties of person and spirit, and raised thee up out of unspeakable sorrows, that the religion of Christ should not perish utterly in the East.
Go forward in the way He has opened unto thee.
Only insist that Mahommed present himself at thy altar, and there swear honorable dealing with thee as his wife, and to keep the treaty proposed by him in spirit and letter.
Doth he those things without reservation, then fear not.
The old Greek Church is not all we would have it, but how much better it is than irreligion; and who can now say what will happen once our people are returned to the city?"
*       *       *       *       *

In the afternoon, a boat with one rower touched at the same marble quay, and disembarked an Arab.
His face was a dusty brown, and he wore an _abba_ such as children of the Desert affect.
His dark eyes were wonderfully bright, and his bearing was high, as might be expected in the Sheik of a tribe whose camels were thousands to the man, and who dwelt in dowars with streets after the style of cities.
On his right forearm he carried a crescent-shaped harp of five strings, inlaid with colored woods and mother of pearl.
"Does not the Princess Irene dwell here?"
he asked.
Lysander, viewing him suspiciously, answered: "The Princess Irene dwells here."
"Wilt thou tell her one Aboo-Obeidah is at the door with a blessing and a story for her?"
The doorkeeper again disappeared, and, returning, answered, with evident misgivings, "The Princess Irene prays you to come in."
Aboo-Obeidah tarried at the Therapian palace till night fell; and his story was an old one then, but he contrived to make it new; even as at this day, though four hundred and fifty years older than when he told it to the Princess, women of white souls, like hers, still listen to it with downcast eyes and flushing cheeks--the only story which Time has kept and will forever keep fresh and persuasive as in the beginning'.
They were married in her chapel at Therapia, Father Hilarion officiating.
Thence, when the city was cleansed of its stains of war, she went thither with Mahommed, and he proclaimed her his Sultana at a feast lasting through many days.
And in due time he built for her the palace behind Point Demetrius, yet known as the Seraglio.
In other words, Mahommed the Sultan abided faithfully by the vows Aboo-Obeidah made for him.
[Footnote: The throne of Mahommed was guarded by the numbers and fidelity of his Moslem subjects; but his national policy aspired to collect the remnant of the Greeks; and they returned in crowds as soon as they were assured of their lives, their liberties, and the free exercise of their religion....
The churches of Constantinople were shared between the two religions.
GIBBON. ]
And so, with ampler means, and encouraged by Mahommed, the Princess Irene spent her life doing good, and earned the title by which she became known amongst her countrymen--The Most Gracious Queen of the Greeks.
Sergius never took orders formally.
With the Sultana Irene and Father Hilarion, he preferred the enjoyment and practice of the simple creed preached by him in Sancta Sophia, though as between the Latins and the orthodox Greeks he leaned to the former.
The active agent dispensing the charities of his imperial benefactress, he endeared himself to the people of both religions.
Ere long, he married Lael, and they lived happily to old age.
*       *       *       *       *

Nilo was found alive, and recovering, joined Count Corti.
*       *       *       *       *

Count Corti retained the fraternal affection of Mahommed to the last.
The Conqueror strove to keep him.
He first offered to send him ambassador to John Sobieski; that being declined, he proposed promoting him chief Aga of Janissaries, but the Count declared it his duty to hasten to Italy, and devote himself to his mother.
The Sultan finally assenting, he took leave of the Princess Irene the day before her marriage.
An officer of the court representing Mahommed conducted the Count to the galley built in Venice.
Upon mounting the deck he was met by the Tripolitans, her crew, and Sheik Hadifah, with his fighting Berbers.
He was then informed that the vessel and all it contained belonged to him.
The passage was safely made.
From Brindisi he rode to Castle Corti.
To his amazement, it was completely restored.
Not so much as a trace of the fire and pillage it had suffered was to be seen.
His reception by the Countess can be imagined.
The proofs he brought were sufficient with her, and she welcomed him with a joy heightened by recollections of the years he had been lost to her, and the manifest goodness of the Blessed Madonna in at last restoring him--the joy one can suppose a Christian mother would show for a son returned to her, as it were, from the grave.
The first transports of the meeting over, he reverted to the night he saw her enter the chapel: "The Castle was then in ruins; how is it I now find it rebuilt?"
"Did you not order the rebuilding?"
"I knew nothing of it."
Then the Countess told him a man had presented himself some months prior, with a letter purporting to be from him, containing directions to repair the Castle, and spare no expense in the work.
"Fortunately," she said, "the man is yet in Brindisi."
The Count lost no time in sending for the stranger, who presented him a package sealed and enveloped in oriental style, only on the upper side there was a _tughra_, or imperial seal, which he at once recognized as Mahommed's.
With eager fingers he took off the silken wraps, and found a note in translation as follows:

"Mahommed the Sultan to Ugo, Count Corti, formerly Mirza the Emir.
"The wager we made, O my friend, who should have been the son of my mother, is not yet decided, and as it is not given a mortal to know the will of the Most Compassionate until he is pleased to expose it, I cannot say what the end will be.
Yet I love you, and have faith in you; and wishing you to be so assured whether I win or lose, I send Mustapha to your country in advance with proofs of your heirship, and to notify the noble lady, your mother, that you are alive, and about returning to her.
Also, forasmuch as a Turk destroyed it, he is ordered to rebuild your father's castle, and add to the estate all the adjacent lands he can buy; for verily no Countship can be too rich for the Mirza who was my brother.
And these things he will do in your name, not mine.
And when it is done, if to your satisfaction, O Count, give him a statement that he may come to me with evidence of his mission discharged.
"I commend you to the favor of the Compassionate.
MAHOMMED."
When the missive was read, Mustapha knelt to the Count, and saluted him.
Then he conducted him into the chapel of the castle, and going to the altar, showed him an iron door, and said:

"My master, the Lord Mahommed, instructed me to deposit here certain treasure with which he graciously intrusted me.
Receive the key, I pray, and search the vault, and view the contents, and, if it please you, give me a certificate which will enable me to go back to my country, and live there a faithful servant of my master, the Lord Mahommed--may he be exalted as the Faithful are!"
Now when the Count came to inspect the contents of the vault he was displeased; and seeing it, Mustapha proceeded:

"My master, the Lord Mahommed, anticipated that you might protest against receiving the treasure; if so, I was to tell you it was to make good in some measure the sums the noble lady your mother has paid in searching for you, and in masses said for the repose of your father's soul."
Corti could not do else than accept.
Finally, to complete the narrative, he never married.
The reasonable inference is, he never met a woman with graces sufficient to drive the Princess Irene from his memory.
After the death of the Countess, his mother, he went up to Rome, and crowned a long service as chief of the Papal Guard by dying of a wound received in a moment of victory.
Hadifah, the Berbers, and Nilo chose to stay with him throughout.
The Tripolitans were returned to their country; after which the galley was presented to the Holy Father.
Once every year there came to the Count a special messenger from Constantinople with souvenirs; sometimes a sword royally enriched, sometimes a suit of rare armor, sometimes horses of El Hajez--these were from Mahommed.
Sometimes the gifts were precious relics, or illuminated Scriptures, or rosaries, or crosses, or triptychs wonderfully executed--so Irene the Sultana chose to remind him of her gratitude.
Syama wandered around Constantinople a few days after the fall of the city, looking for his master, whom he refused to believe dead.
Lael offered him asylum for life.
Suddenly he disappeared, and was never seen or heard of more.
It may be presumed, we think, that the Prince of India succeeded in convincing him of his identity, and took him to other parts of the world--possibly back to Cipango.
