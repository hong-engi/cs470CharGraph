CHAPTER I

THE SUMMONS

“‘_A girl without a sweetheart_,’ girls—(I was readin’ something about it this
very morning ’s I was coming along in the Toob),” chattered little Miss Holt
over her work. “_A girl without a sweetheart is like a ship at sea, without
knowing what port she’s to put in at_——”

“Accounts for the way a lot of ’em seem to pick their sweethearts on the
principle ‘_Any port in a storm!_’” said Miss Robinson, with her little sniff.
“Well! Seems to me there’s a good deal in the idea that a poor husband is better
than none,” came philosophically from Miss Holt, whose back is always curved
like a banana over her typing-table, and who “smarms” her dull brown hair down
under a hair-net until her head looks like a chocolate. “After all, my dear, if
you’re married, you’re married; and nobody can say you aren’t. But if you
_aren’t_ married, you aren’t. And nobody can say you _are_!”. “How true,” said
Miss Robinson dreamily. “Got that, Miss Trant?”

And she gave a sardonic glance towards me, to see if I was thoroughly taking
this in. I was trying not to. The buzz of Cockney whispering which goes on,
intermittently, all day long in our murky “typists’-room” was beginning to get
on my nerves again almost as badly as it did in the first week that I worked at
the Near Oriental Shipping Agency. I didn’t raise my eyes. Then, above the click
and the buzz, came a shriller:

“Miss Trant, if you please?”

My fingers fell from the typewriter, and I looked up with a start into the sharp
little South-London face of our smallest office-boy. “Yes? What is it, Harold?”

“Miss Trant, Mr. Waters says he wishes to see you in his private room at two
o’clock.”

“To see _me_?” I asked in a panic; hoping that it might not be true, that by
some lucky chance my ears had deceived me. They hadn’t. “Yes; at two o’clock
sharp, miss.”

“Very well, Harold,” I heard myself say in a small, dismayed voice. Then I heard
the door of our room shut upon the office-boy’s exit. I turned, to meet the
shrewd, sympathetic brown eyes of Miss Robinson over her machine. “Governor sent
for you?”

I nodded dismally. “Any idea what it’s about, Miss Trant?”

“Oh, it might be about _anything_ this last week,” I sighed. “It might be about
my forgetting to enclose those enclosures to the Western Syndicate. Or for
leaving out the P.T.O. at the bottom of that Budapest letter. Or for spelling
Belgium B-e-l-g-u-i-m. Or half a dozen other things. I knew Mr. Dundonald was
going to complain of me. It’s been hanging over me for the last three days.
Anyhow I shall know the worst to-day.”

“P’raps he’ll give you another chance, dear,” said little Miss Holt. “That’s not
very likely,” I said. “He’s such an abominably accurate machine himself that
he’s ‘off’ anybody in this office who isn’t a machine too, girl or man.”

“D’you suppose the Governor even knows which of us _is_ a girl and which is a
man? because I don’t,” put in Miss Robinson. “I bet you he——”

“Talking in theyairr!” interrupted the grating Scotch accent of Mr. Dundonald,
as he passed through to the Governor’s room, where, alas! I, Monica Trant, was
soon to present myself. A deathly silence, broken only by the clicking of the
four typewriters, fell upon our department. But I’m pretty sure that all the
work _I_ did from then on until lunch-time was of very little good. That gloomy
typists’ room, looking over the “well” of the great buildings in Leadenhall
Street, and so dark that we worked always by electric lights, switched on one
over each machine, faded away from me. I ceased to know I was breathing in that
familiar smell of fog and mackintoshes and dust and stuffiness. I ceased to hear
the muffled roar of the City outside, and the maddening “click! click-a-click-
pprring!” of the typewriters within, as I shut myself into my own mind. Dismally
I reviewed my own situation. *       *       *       *       *

Here was I, “alone in London,” all my poor little capital spent on the business-
training which I had joyfully hoped was going to bring me in a nice
“independent-feeling” income of at least two pounds a week. At the offices of
William Waters and Son, of the Near Oriental Shipping Agency, a post I had
obtained after weeks of weary searching for work, my salary was twenty-five
shillings a week. _Now_, in all probability, I was going to lose even that. And
then what was I to do? How was I to go on contributing my half of the rent of
the Marconi Mansions flat; how was I to pay for even my cheap meals and my
“these’ll-have-to-do” clothes? How _was_ I to earn my living? Obviously, I’m not
cut out for a business-girl! My three months in the office has plainly shown me
that. “You lack method, Miss Trant”—as Mr. Dundonald, the head of our
department, has told me more than once. “You lack _concentrrayshn_. You are
intelligent enough, for a young lady, but when I think I can rrely on you, what
happens? I find ye out in some rideeclus mistake that the rrrawest student from
Pitman’s wouldn’t make. And this after I’ve warrrned you times and again. What
do you think is going to be the end of it?”

Evidently the sack. And what else _is_ there I can do? Nothing! I can’t draw
fashion-plates or write articles for the magazines. Go on the stage—no, I never
_could_ remember my cue, even in private theatricals. I love children—but people
want diplomas and Montessori Systems with their nursery-governesses. For serving
in a shop I don’t suppose I’m tall enough. That’s one of the inconsistencies of
men—they quote poetry about a girl being “just as high as their hearts,” and
then advertise for parlour-maids and mannequins who must stand well over five
foot nine, which I don’t. Though, even if my nickname _is_ “Tots,” thank
goodness I’m not dumpy, like little Miss Holt, who thinks a poor husband is
better than none....

What about the principal profession open to women—getting married? Well, but I
never see any men, now a days—you can’t call things-in-the-City _men_,
exactly—whom I could get married _to_. Besides, there’s nobody, now that I’m an
unbecomingly-dressed pauper, who would want to marry me.—Except, perhaps ...
Sydney Vandeleur ...? Dear old Sydney is a friend left over from the days before
the smash in our family when “_the world was more than kin when we had the ready
tin_.” I’ve seen him several times since, and he was just the same as ever, so
sympathetic and amusing; such a “pal,” and with something about him that made me
quite certain he’d be ready to become something more, the minute I encouraged
him. “Encouraging” him wouldn’t be too unpleasant either, though I never was in
love with Sydney. By this time I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m not a bit
the falling-in-love type of girl. Major Montresor, of father’s regiment in the
old days, told my brother Jack once that “little Monica had the makings of a
first-class flirt; she belonged to the successful Order of the Cold Coquette.”
After listening to the dodderings and drivels and despairs of girls who _aren’t_
cold, I’m rather thankful that I _am_. At least I can be fond enough of people
in a sensible sort of way. I could be of Sydney. I suppose it will end in my
getting him to marry me.... But not yet. I haven’t even got his address! He and
his mother have gone on a tour to Japan, and they won’t be within reach for so
much as a dinner for about a year. Whereas it’s to-day, _this afternoon_, that
I’m to get the sack without knowing what else is to happen to me! A pretty
depressing outlook! *       *       *       *       *

At one o’clock I went out to lunch at what the typists here call “The Den of
Lyons,” with Miss Holt and Miss Robinson. Our fourth typist, pretty, anæmic Miss
Smith, had evidently made other arrangements to-day. She wore another hat; a
fresh bunch of violets was tucked into her long coat, and she monopolized the
looking-glass while she attended to her complexion with a pot of face-cream, a
clean hankie, and a book of _papiers poudrés_. “We’re extremely smart to-day,
Smithie,” said Miss Robinson. “What’s on?”

“I’m going out to lunch with Still Waters.”

This was “the” office joke at the Near Oriental. “Still Waters” meant no one
less than Mr. William Waters, Junior, the head of the firm, who acted as General
Manager, and from whom I had just received that fatal summons. He would as soon
think of having a word to say to one of his typists out of business-hours as of
giving a dance in the office itself. So that the excuse “_I’m going out with
Still Waters_” always means that the speaker intends to keep her engagement to
herself. It’s an open secret in the office that Smithie, who keeps a manicure-
set in her hand-bag and who blushes twice daily down the telephone, has “got
some sort of boy.”

“Oh, all right, haughty! Don’t bother to apologize,” said Miss Holt. And we left
Miss Smith to her preparations. Presently we caught sight of her again in the
crowd outside. She didn’t see us, or anything else, I think. She was smiling and
sparkling and flushed, and “looked as different as a fortnight’s holiday,” as
Miss Robinson said. All three of us glanced from her to the young man she was
with. To bring _that_ transfiguring light into a girl’s face, wouldn’t you have
expected him to be a mixture of some Greek God and Bombardier Billy Wells?—Far
from it. “Smithie’s boy” was scarcely taller than she; narrow-chested office-
shouldered, with a face as pale and peaked as a long envelope. “What a kid!”
criticized Miss Holt as we passed. “All men _are_ awful kids,” pronounced Miss
Robinson, “but you do bar them looking it. Of the two, I don’t know that I
wouldn’t rather have ’em like graven images!”

Which brought us back to the horrible subject of that graven image, our
Governor. Over glasses of hot milk and the poached-eggs-on-toast, the plates of
which rasped on the marble-topped table of the shop that _always_ smells of
steak-and-kidney pie, the other girls made themselves specially agreeable to the
colleague who was preparing for the sack in another hour. “It is too bad. We
shall miss you from our room,” said good-natured little Miss Holt. “Still—(Here,
miss! I said egg, I didn’t say sardine-sandwich! I wish you’d attend when anyone
speaks!... She would, if I’d a boy with me! Such is life! )—Still, it isn’t as
if there wasn’t other posts you could get. Easily. Don’t you look so hopeless,
Miss Trant. You’ve a taking way with you, and a nice smile; wasn’t I passing the
remark, only the other day, about what a pretty smile Miss Trant’d got? And, say
what you like, looks _do_ count when a young lady’s in business!”

“Yes, it’s a pity Miss Trant don’t know she’s good-looking. We ought to have
told her about that, before,” said Miss Robinson dryly. “But you’re all right.
_You’ll_ get taken on somewhere where they don’t make an international affair of
it over one misplaced comma or a tiny smudge off a new ribbon. _You’ll_ get
round the men. I don’t mean Still Waters. He’s not a man, of course. He’s a
machine that can say ‘_Now, Miss Trant!_’”—here she broke into perfect mimicry
of the Governor’s curtest tone. “And’ _What is the meaning of this evening’s
cables being one-fifth of a second after time?_’ He doesn’t count. You try for
something where there’s a human being at the head of affairs——”

“And if it’s near she can come out to lunch with us just the same as before she
left,” suggested Miss Holt. “She hasn’t even left yet,” said Miss Robinson
encouragingly. “What price one of those fancy cakes, Miss Trant? Choose the
least poisonous-looking, and I’ll treat you—for luck!”

*       *       *       *       *

At a quarter to two we got back to the office. I went and washed in the
dressing-room. I took down all my hair. My hair’s my pet vanity; it’s very long
and thick and silky, and “just the colour of massed black pansies against her
honeysuckle-coloured flesh-tints,” as Sydney Vandeleur once said. He “puts”
everything like the artist that he is. (Oh, why wasn’t it to meet _him_ that I
was preparing, instead of that young frozen ogre of a Governor?) I wound the
long swathe smoothly round my head again, pinned it firm, and made sure it was
all right at the back, _not_ with any idea of impressing Still Waters (who would
scarcely have noticed the fact had all his typists been completely bald, so long
as they were efficient), but merely because to feel perfectly neat made me a
little less painfully nervous. The clock, striking two, chimed in with my humble
tap at the door of Mr. Waters’ private room. “Come in!” called the dreaded voice
of our Governor. And, trembling inwardly, in I went. CHAPTER II

THE PROPOSAL

The large, light room, with its handsome furniture, seemed to stretch for miles
between the door and the big writing-desk, covered with green leather, at which
Mr. Waters himself sat, frowning over a letter. The desk was generally bare but
for the note of his day’s appointments, with the hours, on the turnover date-
ticket. “Two o’clock,” and a heavy “X” marked this coming interview, as I could
not help seeing when I finished what seemed like a long and tiring walk over the
thick crimson carpet, and stood meekly at his elbow. He looked up, alert, clean-
shaven, his fair hair brushed as sleek and shiny as the nap of his own silk hat,
his mouth closed as tightly as his own cash-box; he was the very picture of a
successful young City man, whose one and only interest is his business. “Ah!
That you, Miss Trant?” he said, in the quick, curt, business-like voice that
Miss Robinson can imitate so perfectly. He wheeled round in the chair to face
me. “Sit down, please.”

I was thankful to sit down. Although I don’t think my panic showed in my face,
my knees were actually beginning to give under me. Mr. Waters pointed to a
plump, green morocco-covered chair. Down I sat, on the very edge of it. I set my
teeth to listen to what this office tyrant had to say. (How extraordinary that
he and Sydney Vandeleur should _both_ be “men”!) If he only wouldn’t keep me; if
he’d only just tell me to go, and get it over.... But his first remark took me
absolutely by surprise. “Now, Miss Trant. If you don’t mind, I want to ask you a
few questions. Don’t think them impertinent, for they are not so intended, and
they are necessary to the matter in hand. And—please don’t misunderstand them.”

Here his alert face grew even more business-like. His keen grey eyes met my
startled brown ones steadily for a moment. Then he added, in an emphatic,
“_underlined_” sort of tone:

“There is nothing in these questions to which your father, or anyone belonging
to you, could take any exception. You understand?”

“Understand”—No! I certainly didn’t. What could he mean me to understand? I
hadn’t grasped it even when he repeated the question a trifle impatiently. “You
do understand that, Miss Trant?”

“Oh—er—yes—of course,” I murmured, in duty bound. But I was so utterly dazed by
this unlooked-for flight-off-at-a-tangent of the Governor’s that I heard myself
answering as if in a dream the questions he put next. “Twenty-one. You’re of
age, then,” I heard him saying through the daze. “Both parents dead: m’m. No one
else belonging to you?”

“One brother in South Africa,” my lips answered mechanically. And my inward
wonder, “_What on earth has that got to do with Mr. Waters?_” was mingled with
an added dull twinge of anxiety. For I haven’t heard from poor old rolling-
stoney Jack for three months or more. “No one belonging to you in London? M’m.
And you’re dependent for your living upon what you earn here?”

(Yes! or else I shouldn’t have to sit here answering questions about things that
are absolutely no business of yours! was what I thought rebelliously.) I said
aloud, reluctantly, “Yes.”

“Where do you live, then—alone?”

“I share rooms with another girl in Battersea,” I had to tell him, still
wondering resentfully what in the world might be the meaning of this catechism.
_Wasn’t_ it the prelude to dismissal, after all, then? _Wasn’t_ he preparing to
be hateful and sarcastic, and to tell me he felt my talents were being wasted at
the Near Oriental (this is one of Mr. Dundonald’s pet _clichés_), and that he
advised me to look out elsewhere for a better position at a higher salary—if I
could get it? What _would_ be the next question, then? It was _the_ last thing
that I should have dreamed of his asking. “Do you mind telling me, Miss Trant,
whether you are engaged to be married?”

Engaged? I? What _could_ he want to know that for? That was less his business,
even, than any of the other questions he’d put! It seemed doubly odd, since I
_had_ been meditating on the possibility of “getting engaged” that very morning.
Ever since twelve o’clock, the mental image of Sydney Vandeleur’s picturesque,
dark face, with his small Vandyke beard and gentle, adoring brown eyes, had been
very near me. There was always Sydney in the background, of course. Backgrounds
don’t count, presumably. Even if they did, though, what concern was it of my
business employer’s? I did wish I had enough self-assurance to announce frankly,
“Well, I _do_ mind telling you, as a matter of fact!” But ... twenty-five
shillings a week don’t provide a girl with much self-assurance! I could only let
him have the literal answer in return for his direct (and unwarrantable)
question. “Oh, no; I’m not engaged.”

“Good!” said Still Waters briskly. (Why “good”?) “Now, Miss Trant, I can tell
you the reason—or part of the reason—I sent for you this afternoon. I must begin
by impressing upon you very definitely that”—here he paused, and at each word of
the announcement tapped solemnly on the big desk with his finger—“I don’t want
to get married myself.”

“Of course not!” I almost gasped, wondering what in the world this very obvious
truth (for one _could_ not imagine Still Waters in connection with marriage or
engagements) had got to do with me? “At the same time, there are reasons why for
a time, at least—say a year—it should appear that I was going to be married. I
may tell you those reasons later on; that depends. At present I’ll merely tell
you that it is important to me that I should be officially, that is nominally,
engaged.”

I gazed at him. There was no more expression in his face than in the pearl pin
in his expensive-looking grey tie. What could he mean? “I wish it to appear to
everybody—to my family, to my acquaintances, to the people in this office—that I
am actually engaged,” he explained. “I wish to find someone who, to outward
appearances, could take the place of my _fiancée_; could go about with me, stay
at my home, and be introduced all round as the girl I meant to marry. She must
understand from the very beginning that it was absolutely a matter of business;
that the so-called ‘engagement’ would terminate at the end of the year, and that
there could be no possible question of its ending in marriage. If I found this
lady, I would make it worth her while; paying her at the rate of ten pounds a
week for her services. You follow me, Miss Trant?”

I began to “follow,” but I could scarcely believe that he really intended to
carry out this mysterious scheme. It was more like the plot of a Gilbert and
Sullivan opera than any “business” I’d ever heard of in real life. Still more
incredible was what came next. “It seemed to me from the first that the most
suitable person for the post would be—yourself.”

“Me?” I echoed, aghast. Oh, this was getting out of comic opera, and into the
realms of nightmare! Was he _really_ suggesting that I——

“Yes; you, Miss Trant. You are a lady in every essential, if I may say so, of
looks and manner. You seem to possess the gift of making yourself generally
liked. You’re distinctly intelligent, in spite of your work, which is——” here
for one instant a gleam of what looked almost like humour seemed to flash from
the Governor’s eyes. But it was gone again so swiftly that I couldn’t be sure
whether it had ever been there. I must have been mistaken. He went on
imperturbably: “I am a very fair judge of character, and I believe you to be
trustworthy. As a mark of my confidence in you, I shall pay into your account
the whole sum of five hundred pounds so soon as you let me know that you consent
to enter into this arrangement.”

“Five hundred pounds?” I echoed stupidly. “Yes; that is payment for the entire
year at the rate of ten pounds weekly. I hope you will see your way to accepting
it. Think it over to-night, please,” said Still Waters, in his curtest, most
business-like tone, “and let me have your answer here—if you can, that is”
(meaning “you must!”) “at eleven-fifteen to-morrow morning. I need hardly tell
you that this must remain strictly between ourselves. I think that’s all.”

He glanced at the round-topped mahogany clock above the fireplace, then put his
hand out to the row of electric-bell pushes on his desk. Our interview was over.
“Good afternoon, Miss Trant.”

“Good afternoon,” I murmured rather feebly, as I retraced my steps over that
long, long stretch of carpet to the door. I felt furious with myself for lacking
the ordinary pluck to tell the Governor then and there:

“I shan’t need to-night to think the question over. My answer is ‘No!’ I can’t
possibly undertake such an arrangement.”

For how can I? How can I accept such an extraordinary position? “Officially”
engaged to the Governor—the office tyrant, the mummy, the fault-finding
automaton! Fancy “going about” with him, letting everyone imagine that I was
actually going to marry him! Fancy playing that Gilbertian part, with no rouge
and no fun and no footlights to carry me through it, in a “piece” that went on
all day and every day! And fancy—this was almost the most appalling thought of
all—fancy having to face all the other girls in the office. Oh, impossible;
quite impossible! I can’t do it. I must summon up all my courage and tell him so
to-morrow. *       *       *       *       *

“Well?” whispered Miss Robinson, from the next typing-table. “What _did_ the
graven image say? Was he a brute? _Is_ it the sack? Or is he giving you another
chance?”

“I think he means to give me another chance,” I murmured. (Such a chance!) “I
am——”

“_Talking_, ladies!” broke in the warning. “Miss Trant, it’s generally you, I
notice!”

And Mr. Dundonald’s voice brought back the bugbear that has haunted me since
twelve this morning—the terror of being penniless and out of work once more. Oh,
if I could only attain to some job, _some other job_, that would bring me in
that princely salary of ten pounds a week! Imagine the blessed relief, the
security of knowing that one had five hundred pounds in one glorious, solid lump
at one’s back. But then, imagine accepting the Governor’s terms before one
earned it! Oh, no! The bogey “_out of work_” haunted me down into the Tube lift,
along the Embankment, all the way back up our grey Battersea street, with the
red-faced pavement-artist who always touches his cap to me, smiles and points to
his lurid chalk-drawing of a wreck with the legend: “_Like the Artist—On the
Rocks!_”

“I’m on the rocks myself, Blossom. This is probably the last penny I shall be
able to give you!” I told him, with a desperate little laugh. Then I turned in
at the entrance to Marconi Mansions, and climbed up our stone stairs to the
cheap but cosy little top-flat which has for six months meant “Home” to us two
bachelor girls. How long should _I_ be able to afford to share it? CHAPTER III

THINKING IT OVER——

I always expect to be in long before Cicely Harradine, the girl who shares the
place with me. We first made friends in a ten-shillings-a-week bedroom at the
Twentieth Century Club, when she was left much as I was, a waif without any
friends that counted, and with just a tiny lump of capital. This she used up in
paying her fees at the Slade School of Art, where she’d gone, in her innocence,
with a view to taking up fashion-drawing. They all used to say at home that
she’d “a gift” for sketching, and she’d heard—we’ve all heard!—that there are
fortunes to be made out of fashion-plates. Only she hadn’t realized that for a
girl of her sort, lovely and good-hearted and “gormless,” there’s only one way
of getting a fortune; namely, by marrying it. And how _can_ you marry, as she
often says plaintively, if you never even _see_ any “possible” men? All the
people she seems to see nowadays—besides Slade students—are the gorgeous
Jewesses who deal at the “studio” where Cicely’s one real “gift” (that of a
tall, willowy figure) is now turned to advantage by showing off the evening-
frocks and opera-wraps of Madame Chérisette, in Bond Street, in the show-rooms
she can seldom leave until well after seven o’clock. So to-day I was astonished
to find the second-hand, cretonne-covered couch in our sitting-room already
occupied by what looked like a bundle of rugs, dishevelled red curls, and arnica
bandages, whence proceeded the sound of dismal sobs. “Cicely!” I cried, alarmed.
“You back already? Why, what’s happened?”

“Oh, my dear, such an _awful_ catastrophe!” wailed the voice of Cicely, while
the willowy figure twisted itself into sitting up against our cheap flock
cushions. “What do you think? When I went out to lunch this morning I managed to
slip on a bit of banana-skin that some perfect _pig_ had flung down at the
crossing—No, Tots! it _wasn’t_ those shoes I will wear, so you needn’t say
that!—and I twisted my ankle and cut my head on the kerb, and I had to be
brought home in a taxi, and the doctor’s been, and he says I’m to keep my foot
up for a fortnight, and what—what on earth’s to become of my job?” wept Cicely.
“Chérisette won’t take me on again, for there’s a girl waiting _now_ for my
place! A _niece_ of somebody’s! She’ll _snap_ it up! And _what_ am I to do?
Hurp, hurp!”

She could only sob, and I could only stroke her pretty, incompetent fingers.
“There’ll be that _doctor_ to pay! And it’ll be the _rent_ again in three weeks’
time! It’s _always_ being the rent, in this place, Tots! It _never_ was at home.
And _I_ haven’t got any money saved now that I’ve bought that bicycle for
Saturday afternoons. Isn’t it perfectly awful? Hurp, hurp! Oh, girls at home who
get doctors and dentists and washing and everything _f-found_ for them, hurp!
are so fond of _envying_ girls who earn their own livings because it’s so free
and independent—how _can_ they? _They_ wouldn’t want to earn their horrible
livings if they _only_ knew how ghastly it was as soon as you got ill and hadn’t
anything but a few shillings between you and goodness knows!”

“‘_Earned increment is sweet, but that unearned is sweeter_,’” I quoted
bitterly. “Oh, you laugh at everything, Tots! This is serious. _S-s-s-seven-and-
sixpence!_ That’s all I’ve got left in the whole wide world! And _you’ve_
nothing but your twenty-five bob a week!”

(Yes! I thought; and even that modest salary will be lost to me to-morrow. For
when I tell the Governor that I find I can’t accept his offer, he’s pretty
certain to sack me. After his allusion to my “work,” after Mr. Dundonald’s
“warrrnings,” what else need I expect? But this wasn’t the moment to tell my
poor, distracted chum my own bit of bad luck. Even if we _were_ both out of work
and on those rocks together, it must, for the present at least, be kept from
_her_.) “Now look here, don’t you worry,” I said, more cheerfully than I felt.
“You _know_ you’re no end of a ‘find’ as a mannequin, because you’ve got the
voice that goes with the figure. It must be rather a shock when Madame’s clients
ask something that looks like a young duchess in a dream of a gown ‘_What did
you say the price was?_’ and get told in the accents of Whitechapel ‘_Twenty-ite
paounds, Madam!_’ That’s the pull _you’ve_ got, so you know you’re sure of
another good place as soon as your foot’s right. Until then I—I can manage
perfectly well for the two of us. What about something to eat? Mrs. Skinner
coming back to cook to-night?”—Mrs. Skinner is _supposed_ to “do” for us. I
often think that, in another sense, she _will_! “No. She’s off for the whole day
to go to a funeral. You said she might, this morning.”

“So I did. I thought it was a week ago—it feels like it. Well, I’ll get supper.”

*       *       *       *       *

As I passed into our little dark cubby-hole of a kitchen, I saw something that
I’d overlooked before—a letter left lying on the mat, as it had dropped through
the letter-box. I picked it up. It was addressed to me. And at the sight of the
thin foreign envelope and the South African stamp my heart sank even lower. I
had a presentiment that I hadn’t come to the worst yet. It was a letter from my
brother in Cape Town; poor old ne’er-do-weel Jack, who scarcely ever writes
anything more than a picture postcard with a view of the Cape of Good Hope, or
something of that kind, unless he’s in trouble and wants something. With a sigh
I took out the crackling, scrawled sheet; and my eyes fell on the last sentences
first. “_You’ll have to get the money for me, old girl. You know     you can if
you try. Ask Vandeleur to lend it to us; he’d do     anything for you. Haven’t
got his address, or I would have     written to him myself. I am absolutely on
the rocks, so don’t     wait. You’ll have to wire a hundred pounds to the Bank
here——_”

A hundred pounds? Mightn’t he just as well have said “a million”? What was all
this about? I took the letter into my own little room and sat down on the camp-
bed to read it through.... In five minutes I have grasped all that I can take in
at present of the situation; an old one. Jack is in trouble, worse trouble than
ever before. Debts; an I O U that was to fall due in six weeks. Threatened
exposure of—_something_ that he doesn’t explain. “_A business affair?_”

Yes; Mr. Dundonald is quite right. I _have_ “no head for business routine.” My
head’s going round with the bewilderment of it. It _can’t_ mean that Jack, my
own brother, Father’s only son—one of the _Trants_—has been “not quite straight”
with the accounts that are in his care? He must be mad! It must be the hot sun
in that awful country. Not _Jack_——! But to suggest that I should turn to Sydney
Vandeleur for the money, even supposing that I knew where the Vandeleurs were to
be found just now—oh! As if I wouldn’t rather die! Yet there’s nothing else that
I can do——

Stop. There is one thing. For, as if flashed in letters of fire over the dim
purple sky over the London roofs outside my window, I seem to see the words—

“FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!”

And they mean, not only a solution of the difficulties of Miss Trant, typist,
not only comforts and security for Cicely, the show-girl out of work, but the
saving of our family name and honour from disgrace. Help instead of ruin for
that poor dear weak-kneed broken reed of a brother of mine. It’s Providence,
that wildly eccentric scheme of the Governor’s. I don’t care what its object may
be. I only know that now—_now_—I daren’t refuse to fall in with it. Never mind
the details. The main fact is that _I must have that hundred pounds, and this is
the only way to it_. *       *       *       *       *

I’ve just taken supper into our sitting-room, and I’ve been able to smile quite
recklessly down into the woe-begone, girlish face under the arnica bandages.
“Buck up, Cis, and eat some really good scrambled eggs with little bits of ham
chopped up in them. And then there’s some glass loganberries, hot; and
somebody’d been what Mrs. Skinner calls ‘pampering the milk,’ so I got a brown
jar of cream for them. _One_ comfort of living in a _ménage_ without any _men_
(a joke, so please laugh) is that we can eat what we _like_, instead of stodging
horrible, gristly chops and steaks and potatoes every night of our lives. And I
brought in some red ink—not Veuve Emu this time, but really decent Burgundy to
cheer us up——”

“But, my _dear_—!” protested Cicely, with the scared glance of the business-girl
who knows what it costs to eat and drink. “It’s not extravagance. I can afford
it.”

“You can’t! You can only _just_ manage to scrape along for yourself—and you know
your poor darling hat’s awful, and you told me you couldn’t get another—you
haven’t managed to put by a penny for ‘extras’—you told me yesterday——”

“Ah, yesterday! But I shall have some more money—_now_.”

“What?—and you never told me when you came in? What, have Waters and Son
actually given you a _rise_?”

“Supplementary duties,” I explained briefly, drawing a wooden chair up beside
Cicely’s couch and laying a clean towel over it for a tablecloth before I set
down the plate of ham-scramble. “Pretty well-paid, too. Yes. I got the job to-
day. And,” I concluded with resolution, “I begin it to-morrow.”

CHAPTER IV

ACCEPTED! “And when do you think the ‘engagement’ had better be announced? At
once?”

This was what the Governor said to me this morning when I again presented myself
at his desk; this time with the timid “acceptance” which, after poor Jack’s
desperate appeal, is my only alternative. “At _once_?” I gasped. “Oh, but—How
could it? The—well—people would think it so”—I checked a hysterical laugh—“so
_funny_!”

“Funny? What’s funny about it?” took up the Governor, as sharply as if he didn’t
see anything at all odd in the whole situation. But he does. He _must_! What a
hateful trick men have of pretending they’re _not_ pretending—when you’re unable
to prove, in so many words, that they _are_! People talk about women being more
complicated; good gracious! It’s we who are simple and straightforward. What was
I to make of the Governor, when he asked me, in quite an annoyed tone of voice,
“I suppose men at the heads of offices have become engaged to their employees
before now Miss Trant?”

“Y-yes—of course—_Become engaged_.”—He was talking now as if _this_ were
_that_!—“But not if——”

“Not if what?”

“Well, not if they have never seen them to speak to!” I explained falteringly.
“You see, Mr. Waters, the three other typists in my room——”

“Oh! Those girls!” said Mr. Waters casually, and I caught my breath. For in the
tone of those two words from the Head of Affairs I heard the rest of his
meaning—“If _they_ think it odd—if _they_ make difficulties, they can go, at
once.”

I saw that nightmare threat of “the sack” looming again, this time over the
heads of three girls who had worked with and always been very decent to me.
They—if they stood the least bit in this young office tyrant’s way—could go!
“It’s not only the girls,” I urged, clenching my hands to keep them from
shaking, and hating the man who made me so nervous. “It’s—everybody. Mr.
Dundonald, Mr. Alexander, they must all know that you scarcely exchanged a word
with me until you sent for me yesterday, when we—they all thought you were going
to dismiss me——”

“Ah?” said the Governor coolly. “—S-so I can’t tell them, right on the top of
_that_, that we are actually engaged to be married! There’ll have to
be—some—some other sort of warning!”

“Don’t see the necessity myself,” said Still Waters, fixing those keen grey eyes
upon me as if I were a letter-file or a paper-weight, or some other inanimate
object that they’d happened to fall upon while he was meditating on other
things. I wondered if he were thinking that, sooner than be bothered over this
affair, he would sack Mr. Dundonald, Mr. Alexander and his whole staff! “Still,
if you prefer it. You mean that there had better be some intermediate stages;
that I ought to begin by singling you out from the others, seeing more of you,
and so on. Quite so.”

It was uncanny, the cut-and-dried way in which he spoke of proceedings
which—well, are always looked upon as so intensely the opposite of cut-and-
dried! This affair was the imitation of something very different; still, one
hardly expected him to be able to map it all out, like the diagrams in
scientific dressmaking! “Now, how am I supposed to ‘see more’ of you?” he went
on, in the same tone as he might have asked, “_Where must I join this dotted
line to section D?_”

“Ah, I have it.” (The sections were beginning to fit in neatly.) “You will come
into my room here each afternoon in Mr. Alexander’s place, and take down my
letters.”

“Very well,” I agreed, relapsing into my usual outward meekness and inward
rebelliousness. What a _fearful_ nuisance, to be banished to the Siberia of the
Governor’s private room, after the murky but cheery atmosphere of the typists’
“glory-hole,” and the society of three other girls! A couple of years ago I
should have used the shibboleth of my set at home to describe these same
girls—“Terrible!—Impossible!” I should have noticed nothing about them beyond
their cheap “stock” clothes and the Cockney accents that used to be such an
hourly jar to my nerves. I shouldn’t have differentiated the sentimental
“Smithie” from Miss Robinson, who has more capacity in her carbon-stained little
finger than most of the girls who were with me at Wycombe Abbey had in their
heads. I should scarcely have considered them of the same race of being as
myself, and as for being on friendly, talkative terms with them—Well, having to
fend for oneself in the labour-market does knock a good deal of the nonsense out
of one. Here I was, quite annoyed at the prospect of giving up the companionship
of the three for the afternoons! Still, it would be worth it. My employer would
be as good as his word about the five hundred pounds. He’d open an account for
me. And at lunch-time I shall be able to cable that much-needed hundred to Cape
Town. I’m to begin earning it as private clerk—to a living tape-machine! “Yes.
That will be quite the best plan,” he went on. “That will pave the way for it.”
His tone became if anything more “scientifically diagrammatic” still as he said,
“To-day is May fourteen; let me see—How long do you suppose it would take before
it would be considered the natural thing for me to fall in love with you?”

“‘Natural’? How could it ever be considered natural” was on the tip of my
tongue, “for you to fall in love with anybody?—You, who think it ought to be
mapped out into a certain number of days, like that sum about ‘_twenty reapers
reaping so many acres in a week_.’”

Primly I answered aloud, “I should think you could please yourself, Mr. Waters.”

“Well, we will see about that presently,” said my employer, turning to the desk.
“And now there is this——” After speaking about “the time it took to fall in
love,” I thought he’d reached his limit. But no. He went further. From a drawer
that he unlocked he took out a paper that he handed to me. “I have taken the
precaution of having our whole arrangement put down in black-and-white, if you
will kindly sign it here.”

—“In _black-and-white!_”—“_sign——!_”

I felt the angry colour surging up into my face; I was all the more furious
because I dare not show the real rage I was in. “Oh, yes. I’ll sign it,” I said,
with desperate meekness, “if you really think it’s necessary. If you imagine
that I am the kind of girl who might take advantage of our—our contract
afterwards, sue you for breach of promise, or——”

“Come, come!” Still Waters interrupted briskly, peremptorily. “It’s just because
I didn’t think you were ‘that kind of girl,’ amongst other reasons, that I
selected you for my post. This instrument is drawn up largely on your own
account. You have a pen——?”

I took it out of the case fastened to the front of my very utilitarian blue
delaine blouse. I hate wearing it there. I always look upon it as the sign of
servitude and the mark of the beast, but it’s the custom—and business-like.
“Right. Now, Miss Trant, I think that’s all for this morning. You can arrange to
come in and take down my letters each afternoon at a quarter to three, beginning
to-morrow.”

“Yes,” I said, in my meekest tone. *       *       *       *       *

Loud were the murmurs of commiseration that broke from my three friends in my
own room when they heard of this novel arrangement. “What, my dear? _You_ to
take down his old letters? That’s the Governor’s idea of giving you one more
chance, I suppose,” sniffed Miss Robinson, “before he sacks you! Pity he didn’t
tell you to go, and get it over yesterday!”

“He’s simply impossible to please. Why, when I come here first,” said Miss Holt,
“he had had three girls at it in one week and they all came out in tears because
the Machine had snapped their heads off. For one thing, he dictates at such a
rate that I don’t know how he expects anyone to follow him without they have to
ask him to repeat it, and _then_ he glowers at you like a Gordian! See if he
doesn’t!”

“It’ll be ‘_Now, Miss Trant!_’” mimicked Miss Robinson, gabbling at top-speed.
“‘_Got that? Go on_—

“‘_We can offer no further explanation of same beyond facts already supplied,
and are of opinion that there is nothing to be gained by prolonging this
correspondence._’ Certainly nothing to be gained by you, my poor dear!”

“No, he’ll be sending for that stolid Scotch Sandy back before the afternoon’s
over!”

“Don’t discourage the girl too much before she starts. Still, I wish you weren’t
forsaking our room for the afternoons, Miss Trant. We shall miss your merry
prattle and your footstep on the stair.”

“Yes, and there won’t be much prattling for you in there,” said Miss Smith.
“More like sitting among the mummies and sphinxes and things in the British
Museum. Girls, can you imagine Still Waters ‘prattling’ to anybody, even as a
little boy?”

“That man was never anything so human as a little boy,” declared Miss Robinson.
“He was created grown-up and ready-made and put together like a Remington.
Probably in the very act of clicking out—

“‘_Contract B.954. Our buyers advise us as under_,’ and so on. “I wouldn’t mind
what I betted that _he_ never cried over going to school for the first time, or
began to fancy himself more when he’d sat out at a dance and flirted——”

“_Flirted!_ The Governor!” I put in—quite forgetting What would presumably be my
cue very soon, and laughing with the others. “You might just as well think of
him falling really desperately in love with——”

“_Talk_-ing, ladies,” broke in the usual voice, followed by the usual lull. But
the usual twinge of fear didn’t visit me this time. Let Mr. Dundonald report me;
let him complain of me, bitterly, to the Governor if he likes! All Caledonia,
stern and wild, can’t get me turned out of the Near Oriental _now_. To-morrow
sees me unshakably installed as—the Governor’s private clerk! *       *       *
*       *

I must say Mr. Waters is even more paralysingly alarming to work for in this
capacity. His dictation—Well! Miss Robinson described it. He simply doesn’t
realize, doesn’t _mean_ to realize, that “a clerk” is composed of anything more
than a pad and a scurrying pencil. He literally does not _see_ that these
objects may be trembling in the grasp of the anxious slip of a young woman, who
has to guide them! He’s excruciatingly particular about the transcribing of his
sheaf of letters. And I shudder—that is, I _should_ have shuddered only last
week—to think what would happen to Miss Trant, typist, if she brought in
anything to be signed one second after four-thirty, which is his time for
leaving. But now I’m secure in the knowledge that however much that machine of a
young man with the closed cash-box of a mouth may long to sack me as a typist,
my other, more lucrative, post could not be so easily filled. Hurray! *       *
*       *       *

To-day is Friday: that Day of Terror in the office, the day of the outward
mails. But it’s brought no terror to me. My week’s salary, if you please, has
amounted to eleven pounds, five shillings. Twenty-five shillings of that was
paid out to me in the usual way by Mr. Wallis, our cashier—little dreaming that
my purse was already bulging with ten more than welcome sovereigns that I got in
exchange for my own cheque (The grandeur of that!) at the Bank where that
providential five hundred pounds (four hundred since) has been put down to the
account of “Miss M. Trant.”

I daren’t allow myself to think what would have happened if it hadn’t been for
that. As it is, I am able to take home quite a lot of invalid dainties to Cicely
(left to the tender mercies of Mrs. Skinner) as well as a lovely lemon-coloured
azalea in a pot, and a brand-new novel (four-and-six—half her share of the
house-keeping money!). Spending this fortune will come fatally easily to me, I
know. But I’ve a dim presentiment that the earning of it isn’t going to be as
easy as that! This morning, which now seems about a year since I began my
“supplementary duties,” Harold summoned me to appear at twelve o’clock, instead
of after lunch, before the Governor. First of all I was seized with nervous
flurry, wondering what on earth I’d done. Then I remembered that it wouldn’t
really matter about that. What mattered was what I should _have_ to do next?
There was another cut-and-dried plan for this in the very tone of the Governor’s
“Good morning” when he glanced up to see me standing submissively beside his
desk again. “Now, Miss Trant, you have been working in here exactly a
fortnight,” he reminded me. “Exactly a fortnight.” I wonder if he is going to
keep count of every one of the three-hundred-and-sixty-five days of the year
which must elapse before I shall be able to say a gleeful good-bye to him and
his diagrammatic “engagement?” I expect so: I expect there’s a time-table for
each one, drawn up and carefully put away for reference in one of the locked
drawers of his big cleared desk. “I think that something more might be done at
once about this arrangement of ours.”

“Oh, yes?”

(A fortnight! Neither too long nor too short a time, he probably considered, for
some “fresh development” to take place.) “So what about my taking you out to
lunch to-day?”

What about it? A vivid mental picture of the expression on the faces of Miss
Robinson, Miss Holt and Smithie rose before me. What—_what_ would they look like
when——Well! They’ve _got_ to look it sooner or later, so it might as well
_begin_ to-day. “Certainly,” I nearly said. Then I hesitated. No! Why _should_
he be able to “fit in” every single detail of his plans, with the ease of a born
jig-saw genius? Why shouldn’t he have to make some rearrangement, consult
someone else’s convenience for _once_ in his life? I would just try to put my
tiny little spoke in his wheel here, to _see_. “Mr. Waters, would you mind
making it to-morrow instead?”

“Much the same to me,” returned my employer rather unexpectedly—still, I suppose
he _would_ allow a twenty-four hours’ margin in these arrangements, in case of
accidents. “But why wait?”

“Oh, because”—No woman ever does anything for _one_ unadulterated motive; a
thing men won’t understand! So I had my second choice of reasons quite ready,
and it was quite naturally, as well as truthfully (for I _was_ thinking of
Smithie’s preparations for an outing), that I suggested—“it would seem more
‘natural’ if I were to have on a new—my best hat to go out to lunch in instead
of the little old cap I put on because of this drizzle to-day.”

“Ah! Very well,” said Mr. Waters, with his succinct nod. He added, “I suppose
that sort of thing is what they mean when they say—when _women_ say—that women
have a much better eye to detail in business than men have?”

(I don’t _quite_ know how he meant that. But never mind, Mr. Cut-and-Dried. I
_have_ altered your time-table by a day, at least!) “To-morrow, then,” said Mr.
Waters, after I had said “Is that all?” And I went. *       *       *       *
*

The next day was a regular “new-hat” day. Just the sort of day to go out to
lunch with a “hovering” _fiancé_—a real one!—I thought, as I set off down the
Embankment, leaving Cicely, whose foot isn’t quite right even yet, at the open
sitting-room window with a novel. It was brightly sunny, but, although we’re
nearly in June now, there was a nip of cold in the breeze; the smile of a
flirt—of a “cold coquette,” as Major Montresor described me once. I wonder what
_he’d_ think if ever he met me again? Probably that it was just like little
Monica to “pull off” making a good match with another froggy-natured person. I
laughed at this as I was walking along to the corner where I get the motor-bus.
After all, there’s nothing to do but laugh at it—at the whole affair. Actually,
it was a momentous choice to have thrust upon any girl; and it might have
cruelly embarrassing side-issues. But what’s the good of dwelling on momentous
and cruel aspects of subjects that _have_ a comic side to them? The only way is
to look hard at that comic side—to see the joke, the whole joke, and, most
important of all, _nothing but the joke_. I felt satisfactorily strung up to the
coming “fun” of the situation when I got into the typists’ dressing-room at the
Near Oriental. Here I found Miss Holt listening to Miss Smith, evidently a
little headachy and nervous, attempting to “stand up” to Miss Robinson in some
argument. “The matter with _you_,” she was saying pettishly, “is that you’re
setting up to be a _man_-hater!”

“Setting up? No such luck,” said Miss Robinson, maddeningly good-tempered. “If
_I_ could ever see a fellow I didn’t think was awful, I’d begin thinking of
setting up. But where _are_ all the men, good gracious? What does a girl ever
see, working in holes of offices? Weeds! Indoor weeds, smelling of stale
Virginians and wearing Number Thirteen collars.”

“Collars aren’t anything!” Miss Smith flushed an angry pink. “No; but what they
go round are. And I must say I like to see a chap with a good, thick, strong-
looking one (that’s why all the _nice_ girls love a sailor, Smithie) with plenty
of sunburn and no spots on it, and—Hul-_lo_, Miss Trant!”

I had turned up at the right moment to prevent a squabble—I and my brand-new hat
bought out of Chérisette’s window, no less! and provided by the princely salary.
“I say, Miss Trant, my child, you’re blossoming out!” commented Miss Holt, all
eyes and envy. “How much did that roof cost you? It’s a good one.”

“It _is_ rather a good one,” I admitted quietly. “I’m so glad you like it.”

But I said no more until the morning’s work was over and we had trooped back
into the dressing-room to get ready for going out at one o’clock. Then:

“I can’t come to lunch to-day,” I said, drawing on the deliciously
“fresh”-feeling white gloves I’d bought for myself at the same time as the hat,
and giving a glance round the dressing-room to make sure that they all took in
the next announcement. “I’m going out.”

“Who with?” seemed to burst, of its own accord, from three pairs of lips at
once. Drawing myself up to what there is of my full height, I smothered an
inclination to giggle foolishly, and answered with starchy dignity, “Since you
_must_ know, I’m going out to lunch with Still Waters.”

“Oh, my dear, give that old joke a rest,” urged the most frequent user of “the
old joke,” Miss Smith, flushing anew with interest, “and tell us who HE is! This
is something quite new, Miss Trant, isn’t it? Doesn’t she look conscious, girls?
Didn’t I know that hat meant something? How exciting! I’m _so_ glad, dear; but,
do tell us! Not his name, of course——”

For in the code of these girls, it’s not fair to ask for names. “—but just his
_Christian_ name!”

“William,” I admitted, smiling as “coyly” as I could. “William! Sounds a
bit—stand-offish,” objected Miss Holt. “D’you call him ‘_Billy_,’ by any
chance?”

“Never,” I said solemnly, “not by any chance.”

“Of course not. ‘Billy’s’ no class,” said Miss Robinson. “‘William? Ahem!
_William!_’” in a pompous bass voice. “Dark or fair, Miss Trant?”

“Fair.”

“M’m. Well, I suppose Miss Trant _would_ pick a fair one, her being such a reel
brunette,” commented Miss Holt, “but as for me, I never could take to a fair
man. Puts me in mind of weak tea. About as fair ’s the Governor, Miss Trant?”

“Ye-es; just about.”

“Anything for a bit of a change,” said Miss Robinson satirically. “I should have
thought you’d have liked another colour to sit opposite to at lunch, after
having to have the same sort of thing staring you in the face all the afternoon.
However!—no accounting for ’em!... I hope he’s tall, though?”

“Over six foot, I should think.”

“Ah! Well grown, William! Is the young gentleman in the City, may I ask?”

“Yes, he is.”

“Isn’t she a good sort, answering all our impertinent questions like this! One
more, Miss Trant, and we won’t bother you. Where are you going to meet him?”

I don’t think she expected that I _would_ answer this. But I said quite frankly,
“I am to meet him just outside the front entrance in Leadenhall Street.” And I
whisked out of the room to the lift. I didn’t tell the girls “Look out of that
window on the other side of the landing and you’ll see him.”

I knew it wasn’t necessary. In two minutes’ time I was being helped into a taxi
by the august hand of our Governor himself. I lifted my head and looked straight
up at the landing window. Yes, there they were, all three of them, flattening
their noses against the pane. I nodded and smiled with bravado. My three
colleagues were too utterly taken by surprise to even smile back at me. The
expression on their three faces was even more pronounced than as I had foreseen
it. Miss Holt was standing in front, and as we drove away I saw her eyebrows
rise to her netted hair, while her mouth dropped open. I could almost _hear_ the
gasp that came from it, of:

“_Girls!_ Did you _ever_? She really _is_!—with Still Waters! Well! What _ever_
next?”

CHAPTER V

THE FIRST LUNCH TOGETHER

“To the Carlton,” ordered Mr. Waters; and off we drove. I hadn’t been inside the
Carlton since the days before the “smash”—the days when I was a young lady of
leisure, without an idea that I should presently be toiling in the grimy
typists’ room at the Near Oriental from nine o’clock until six, wearing home-
made delaine shirts, and trembling lest I might lose my hard-earned twenty-five
shillings a week! The last time I’d been taken there to tea, after a matinée, by
my brother Jack and Sydney Vandeleur, who had ordered roses of a very special
pink to match the frock I’d worn then, and had sent a message to the band to
play my favourite waltzes. Yes, as Jack said, Sydney would do anything for me,
always. I expect Jack thought that the hundred pounds which saved his name came,
as he suggested, from the Vandeleurs. Well, I couldn’t possibly “give away” the
truth about the anomalous position his sister accepted in order to earn the
money! Thank goodness, the Vandeleurs were at the other end of the world, and
wouldn’t be home for a year, thought I. By then my time would be up, and they
needn’t know of my make-believe “engagement”—except that it was “broken off”! “I
telephoned for a table,” said Mr. Waters, as we left the ordinary work-a-day
world of hurrying people and crowded, petrol-breathing motor-buses in the
Haymarket, and entered the restaurant—warm, perfumed, bright with dainty clothes
and pretty faces that smiled above the little tables. Ours was in a delightfully
cosy corner, next to an empty table reserved for three persons. The decorations
were of pink hothouse roses, almost the same as Sydney’s! How very different
from that marble-topped table in the crowded “Den of Lyons” above which Miss
Robinson, Smithie and little Miss Holt were probably even now gossiping
excitedly over this event; but _how_ much rather I would have been with them!
“Now, Miss Trant, what do you prefer for lunch?”

(_My_ only variation of lunch for the last year having been from “Bovril and a
baked apple” to “Poached-egg-on-toast, with a glass of hot milk.”)

“I don’t mind at all.”

“Then I’ll order.”

And very delicious were the things he did order. Apparently even a machine liked
perfect _bisque de homard_, and crisp whitebait—his one touch of nature, in
fact. I longed for Cicely—who does love nice food, poor child!—to be there to
help me enjoy this. In fact, I wished that Cicely and I could have had the lunch
to our two gossiping selves. How we should have enjoyed all the luxuries, from
the pretty glass to the freedom to chat, softly but unrestrainedly, about
everyone we noticed in the place. I have heard it said that “Women would rather
talk to other _women_ than to _men_, even when they would rather talk to a _man_
than to a _woman_.” I don’t think I’ve often met any single man I’d rather talk
to than to a fairly amusing member of my own sex. You have to say most things
twice to men, and then they don’t really understand.... Still Waters, of course
(as his typists explain to each other at least four times in a morning), isn’t
what you could call a man. Somehow, in surroundings that used to be more
familiar to me than offices and City streets, I lost a little of that awe-struck
nervousness of my employer. For a time I could almost forget he was that. He
became—Well! he made me feel as I did in the old days when I had got someone
very heavy-in-hand to take me in to dinner, or as if I were sitting out a dance
with some rather hopeless partner. I mean that was about as far as any
conversation between us went—a few stilted, distrait remarks, punctuating long
stretches of silence. Meanwhile, I glanced round the big place at the other
luncheon-parties, people laughing and chatting together—out evidently for
amusement, not “business”! Several times I caught glances directed at our own
table. I wondered what the people were thinking of us—of the enormously tall,
fair young man with “City” stamped all over him, from his smooth head to his
glossy boots, and the small, dark-eyed girl in the black velours hat which
looked so very much more expensive and stylish than her neatly-cut but ancient
serge costume would lead them to expect. Perhaps they thought that the big young
man with the face as expressionless as a fireproof curtain was slightly bored by
taking his country cousin round the sights of London? Perhaps they thought we
were really engaged? It didn’t matter. There was no one in the restaurant who
knew either of us. Idly I wondered who would come in and take the “reserved”
table close to us. “Miss Trant, you took good care that the other typists knew
for a fact with whom you were coming out?”

“Oh, yes. They were all looking out of the landing window as we drove off.”

“Good!” said Still Waters. And again I almost fancied that I caught that flash
of something like humour in his granite-grey eyes, as I’d fancied it before,
when he spoke about my “intelligence” and my work. But again it was gone before
I could make sure. I was glad. One doesn’t want a machine to have any sense of
humour. And I shouldn’t find it so easy and unembarrassing to be on terms of
“official fiancéedom” with anything but a machine. “I shall take you out to
lunch two or three times this week,” he announced, in his orders-for-the-day
voice, “and perhaps to tea. On Saturday I shall ask you to come with me to a
matinée that you can talk about, and so on, to the others.”

“Very well, Mr. Waters,” I said meekly. “And now that we’ve led up to it in this
way, I see no point in waiting. So next week, Miss Trant, the ‘engagement’ had
better be announced.”

“Certainly,” I agreed, again picturing to myself the stupefaction of everybody
at the Near Oriental, from Mr. Dundonald (a pity the shock can’t incapacitate
him for life!) down to Harold. At home there’d be Cicely. I’m fond of her, but I
dread this. She takes such an _exasperating_ interest in anything that can be
called a love-affair. I myself can’t see what there is so thrilling about “Who
is going to marry whom, and why?”

But Cicely positively “collects,” just as some people collect book-plates, all
she can find out on this hackneyed subject. I know she’ll insist on treating
this arrangement between my employer and myself as a real, romantic “_affaire de
cœur_.” Well, I suppose I shall _have_ to keep from slapping her! Then there’ll
be Mr. Waters’ friends, whoever they are, to whom I shall have to be introduced
as the girl he’s going to marry. (Oh, _lor’!_ as Mrs. Skinner puts it.) “After
which,” pursued the Governor, “I think I shall have to ask you to——What is it,
Miss Trant? Just seen somebody you know?”

“Yes,” I managed to murmur; “I know the lady who has just come in—at the next
table.”

For at the table which had been reserved for three, two of the party had just
turned up. One was a fair-haired young girl, expensively frocked in blue velvet,
but still looking like school-room tea. The other—how well I knew the slim,
well-preserved silhouette of her figure, the carefully-graded bloom of her face!
It was Lady Vandeleur, whom I’d imagined to be in Japan! She is a charming
woman, but she has two faults. One is that, with a son of thirty-two, she
insists on remaining twenty-five. The other is that, unlike dear old Sydney, to
whom the downfall of the Trant fortunes made absolutely no difference, she’s
never really liked me since the “smash.”

Before that, she was quite eager to explain that I was “already” like a young
daughter to her. But it’s two years since I heard the tone of effusive affection
with which Sydney’s mother was speaking to the girl beside her. “My dear child,
aren’t you _starving_? I vote we begin. That naughty boy of mine is so late. We
really can’t wait for Sydney!”

“For Sydney!” Goodness! Then presently Sydney himself would join them. He would
take the chair that faced our table—to which his mother sat with her back
turned. He would see me—he’d be sure to come across and speak! My mind was in a
whirl of wondering what Sydney Vandeleur would think when he saw the girl he
admired lunching _tête-à-tête_ at the Carlton with that big, imperturbable
stranger. And then Sydney himself came in. I was in the middle of a particularly
ambrosial _pêche Melba_, and anyone would have thought I didn’t raise my eyes
from it. But thank goodness, my eyelashes are long enough for the purpose
they’re given a girl—to be looked up through, without a man seeing. In a flash
I’d taken in all of Sydney that one could see; his general appearance of a
Cavalier’s portrait; his look at the girl, his mood, a slightly different way
he’d had his hair (longish) and his little Vandyke beard trimmed since I saw him
last, the clothes he was wearing....

Of course nine girls out of ten never notice a man’s ordinary clothes. Evening-
dress they recognize; and, of course, flannels, because those are white, and
allow the man (especially after a hard game) to look a decent shape if he is
one. Anything else is lost on them. But I’m the tenth girl. As Major Montresor
once said, when he was huffy with me for telling him his new Norfolk jacket was
“too undergraduatey” for him, “Little Monica notices like a valet!”

Sydney’s clothes one couldn’t _help_ noticing; he’s so well-turned-out, but
never in a stereotyped style; in fact, he refuses to be dressed, as he calls it,
“through a stencil.” I’m sure he’d rather put on a false nose and walk down St.
James’s Street in it than appear in that hideous conventional “rig” of the
Governor’s. To-day, for the Carlton, Sydney wore grey of such an exquisite soft
stuff that it was hard to believe it came from any ordinary man’s tailor; the
tie below his bare throat was dove-colour shot with heliotrope, and his silk
socks and the line in his shirt with its soft collar matched it exactly. There
was one dark Russian violet in his button-hole. All these details were familiar
to me before Sydney so much as cast a glance at our table. Then, in a lull, when
I refused coffee, he seemed to prick up his ears. With a quick turn from the
girl in blue velvet, he looked straight across and saw me at last. “_Monica——!_”

I heard the quick, delighted, recognizing exclamation break from my old
admirer’s lips. (I _know_ he admires me, so why not say so?) For the life of me,
I couldn’t help raising my eyes and meeting his own fixed upon me. He half rose.
Then his glance fell upon my companion. Mr. Waters was then in the act of
putting money down upon the little tray the waiter handed. And then I saw the
expression of eager delight on Sydney’s dark, rather dreamy-looking, face give
place to a hurt surprise, as he sat back again in his chair. At the same moment
Lady Vandeleur turned quickly, fixing her own gaze upon our table. Immediately
the gaze became a blank stare, while her exquisitely-pencilled eyebrows rose
almost to the edge of her costly “transformation.” She’d recognized me, of
course. But stony displeasure and outraged convention gleamed in the eyes that
she instantly averted. You see, in her world a girl of my age is not supposed to
lunch at the Carlton without a chaperon of some sort, and with an unspecified
young man. Up to this occasion I, Colonel Trant’s daughter, had been of that
world, of those conventions. The Vandeleurs were evidently shocked at the lapse.
Dear old Sydney, old-fashionedly chivalrous towards women, was also old-
fashionedly strict; and his mother—well! she was merely glad of the excuse to
cut me. Under the circumstances I need not have minded. But one is not
consistent. I minded horribly the idea of what they might be thinking about
me—that I had become horrid, forward, fast. Something that seemed as hard and
hot as a baked paving-stone seemed to settle between my chest and my throat as I
fumbled at the last button of my long white gloves, and, in answer to Mr.
Waters’ business-like “Ready, Miss Trant?” I rose to follow him out. Lady
Vandeleur’s tortoiseshell-handled lorgnette rose also. I saw her turn a
searching scrutiny upon my blond, glossily-groomed, well-to-do looking escort.
Again a horrible hint of what she might be thinking of me passed through my
mind. She knew I worked now in the City; she would think—Sydney would think—I
had made it an excuse for “picking up” the attentions of a wealthy business-man,
perhaps my employer. From every point of view it is considered “bad form” for
the head of a firm to have anything to say to his typist out of business-hours.
All this she would say to Sydney, and to that girl. No, I couldn’t stand that!
There seemed only one thing in the world for me to do. “I’m forced into it,” I
thought rapidly, “so here goes.”

I touched Mr. Waters’s sleeve, murmuring:

“Please wait a moment.”

He stopped, looking down at me inquiringly. I turned, smiling, to that slim,
expensively-gowned figure of outraged propriety at the other table. I accosted
her as if I thought she had not seen me. “Lady Vandeleur, don’t you know me?”

My own voice sounded strangely artificial in my ears, but, thank goodness, it
was steady enough, with every syllable distinct. “Will you allow me to introduce
Mr. Waters, my fiancé?”

There! It was said! Transformation scene upon that carefully-preserved face at
the table! Gone, vanished, was the icy displeasure. A radiant smile, a gracious
bow to the imperturbable Mr. Waters met my announcement. An effusive clasp of
both my own hands. “My dear child, what surprising, what delightful news! How
glad I am for you,” cooed Lady Vandeleur. How glad she was for herself—glad to
think that a hopelessly ineligible girl, for whom Sydney had always displayed a
regrettable weakness, was now safely out of harm’s way—and his! Her
gratification at this made her quite as affectionate as she had been in the days
when the Trant family was still worth marrying into. “So long since we heard
anything of you, you naughty child! But this quite makes up. Yes, we _were_
away; but there were alterations in our plans”—with a quick gesture, a quick
glance, towards the pretty débutante opposite to her, evidently her latest
“plan” for Sydney. “Now we are back in town for the season. The old address, you
know, in Belgrave Square. Wednesday is my afternoon. Now, promise you will come
and see us. A ‘soon’ Wednesday, mind! Do bring your _fiancé_!”

“I shall be delighted.” It was the Governor’s imperturbable voice that answered
her. At that moment I could not have spoken. For as Sydney was murmuring
conventional congratulations I had caught sight of the look in his eyes. They
are handsome eyes, deep and brown and soft, like the eyes of some spaniels; and
just then they looked so bitterly hurt that I felt as if I had been cruel to
some nice dog or some helpless child. Perhaps Sydney cared more than I had ever
imagined. I felt quite miserable when at last the purring farewells and the “so
very glad, dear childs” were left behind us, and we passed out of the
restaurant, through the wheeling glass doors into the Haymarket once more. As we
walked up to Piccadilly Circus I turned to the Governor with the apologies I
felt I owed him. “I’m so very sorry, Mr. Waters! There seemed nothing else to be
done. Those people—they were old friends of my father’s; they would have thought
it so odd for me to be lunching alone with you.”

“Oh, quite so, quite so!” put in the Governor, matter-of-fact and reassuring. “I
quite realized the situation.”

Did he? Not all of it! Poor Sydney! I have never felt nearer the possibility of
falling in love with Sydney in my life. But the Governor was still speaking. “In
fact, I was not at all sorry that the occasion happened to come up. It means, of
course, that the announcement will have to be made rather earlier.”

“Oh, yes,” I agreed, with the usual sinking of the heart. We had reached the
Circus now, and before I knew what he was going to do, Mr. Waters had stepped
quickly across to those sailor-hatted, shawled flower-women, whose baskets make
such a gorgeous splash of colour against the stone background of the fountain.
Back he came with a cluster of great red, fragrant carnations, which he handed
to me. “Oh, but really you should not have——” I was beginning, when I realized
that this also was part of the business—that never had flowers been offered from
man to maid under quite such unromantic circumstances before, and that I had
better take Still Waters’ gift as ostentatiously as I could. I tucked the sweet
crimson blooms into the breast of my blue serge coat. As we whizzed citywards in
a taxi, the Governor spoke again. “Now, Miss Trant, there is another suggestion
I have to make to you,” he began. “To begin with, if I may say so, I like the
way you dress.”

Crisp, concise, business-like syllables; no girl could have interpreted them
into a _compliment_! “I like the way you go to business—always neat, always
ladylike. No ear-rings, no dingle-dangles and low necks like some of them;
always a very clean collar and a quiet tie, I notice—just the thing for the
office. But when I take you out rather more, I suppose you will have to have one
or two rather special evening gowns and afternoon frocks, and theatre-wraps, and
so on. I don’t know what they’re called. No doubt you know the kind of thing to
order. All part of the arrangement, you understand. I’ll get a friend of mine in
the City, whose wife runs a really first-class dressmaking business, to let me
have the address; and then you will go to her—”

All cut-and-dried, like all his other schemes! But this was something
different—very different as well. —“have yourself fitted out with all that is
necessary, and send in the bills to me.”

“Please, no. Not that,” I heard myself say quickly. My employer turned upon me a
face with some of the imperturbability quite jerked out of it by surprise.
“What’s that?”

“If you don’t mind, I can’t—I would rather not do so as you suggest about that,”
said I, holding my head very high, but feeling myself turn as crimson as the
flowers in my coat, and speaking rather shakily, for this was the first time I
had ever asserted my own feelings in even the mildest way before him. “I—I know
it seems like straining at a gnat after all the camels that I am preparing to
swallow. Of course I will _get_ the frocks and things. Only—please, you must
allow me to pay for them out of my allowance—my salary.”

He looked at me doubtfully. “That seems scarcely fair—to you. It means paying
out your own money on things, that—well! I thought that would obviously come out
as ‘_business expenses_.’”

I said, feeling miserably uncomfortable, “Don’t you see that I can’t possibly
allow you to pay for—to give me _frocks_?”

“But—don’t you understand that—in the way of business, you will have to allow me
to give you other things?”

“Other things? What?”

“Why, presents. I don’t know what, exactly. You will probably have to come round
the shops with me yourself, and tell me. You are the best judge of what a girl
would like to show, as gifts, keepsakes, what-nots, from the man to whom she is,
presumably, engaged. It is part of this affair!” explained Mr. Waters, a little
impatiently, as the taxi was held up at a crossing and waited panting for the
signal to get on. “It would ‘look odd,’ as you yourself expressed it once, if I
did _not_ offer you presents.”

“Presents,” I said, feeling really indignant with him for being so obtuse, “are
very different. For one thing, I should not have to keep _them_ always. They
would go back to you at the end of the year, as soon as that paper I signed for
you is torn up. But—girls don’t take _clothes_ as presents, _ever_!”

“I don’t see why not,” he said obstinately. “Besides—don’t they! A cousin of my
own, a girl” (fancy his having a girl-cousin!) “who was staying with us last
winter used to wear a magnificent stole and a muff of leopard-skin—the leopards
had been shot by her _fiancé_.”

“Those were _furs_,” I explained. “Furs are different.”

“A great many things would seem to be ‘different’ from what I imagined,” he
said, in a tone of voice that was almost petulant. I felt inclined to say, “Yes!
_You_ imagined that because you’re as infallible as a tape-machine in business-
hours, you can’t make mistakes outside the office!”

Whereas Sydney Vandeleur, who has no “business” outside his amateur art
criticism, with an occasional design for hand-wrought jewellery, would never
have made the _faux pas_ this man had done. It was so absurdly ignorant and
_gauche_ of him not to see it. And even now he seemed inclined to dispute the
point. “Feathers, now,” he said a little satirically. “Might not a girl wear a
couple of really good, expensive ostrich plumes, or whatever you call them—the
things that hang down the back like a sort of Niagara of fluff—if they were sent
to her by a man with facilities for buying direct from South Africa?”

“Oh, yes,” I said readily, feeling as if I were an editress answering “_Queries
on Etiquette_.” “Feathers are _quite_ as permissible as furs.”

“Even supposing them to be very costly? Worth as much, say, as five times the
amount of the rest of the lady’s wardrobe?”

“It’s nothing to do with the cost,” I explained patiently. “A twenty-guinea fox
stole a girl _might_ accept from a man. A four-pound frock she _couldn’t_.”

“I confess I don’t understand these _nuances_,” said Mr. Waters, almost absent-
mindedly. I said, “Any _girl_ would.”

“Possibly. I can’t help wondering what held good instead of the fur-and-feathers
edict in the days when they composed——What I was going to say,” he broke off
quickly, “was that I always imagined that young French girls were brought up to
be more strict in these matters than English ones. Yet I know a French girl—”

(Surprising! He knows a girl!) —“her father’s an old business acquaintance of
mine—”

(Ah, that explains it.) —“and neither her father nor the young lady seemed to
find anything curious about the matter, when, in payment of some bet made at a
flying-meeting, I bought her quite a large boxful of pairs of gloves.”

“Oh, gloves! Anybody can give gloves to anybody,” I told him. “_Gloves_ aren’t
like clothes.”

“No, but I see some clothes about nowadays that are uncommonly like gloves!”

_Could_ it have been the Governor who muttered this _sotto voce_ to himself? No!
It must have been the comment that flashed through my own mind, and that I
imagined spoken aloud as the burly policeman whose back I had been studying
during this interlude dropped his hand and allowed our taxi to whizz forward
into the writhing tangle of traffic. There was no further stopping or talking
until at last we reached the imposing entrance of the Near Oriental Shipping
Agency offices. I noticed that the Governor’s level eyebrows rose a trifle as he
looked at the indicator of the fares before paying the driver. Yes, I am sure
that many fifteen shillings’ worth of taxi-drive haven’t seemed as long. I only
hope this florin’s worth was as endless to him as it was to me! Then, just as I
was turning away, my employer surprised me by saying brusquely but quite nicely,
“Miss Trant, you must do just as you like in the matter of—of which we’ve been
speaking. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. I am sorry if I did—You
understand that?”

“Oh, of course,” I said, all meekness again. And then I set my teeth before I
ran up the stairs into the typists’ dressing-room and prepared to face the eyes
of my three friends, Miss Robinson, Miss Holt and Miss Smith. CHAPTER VI

WHAT THEY SAID

In the dressing-room, where Miss Robinson was rinsing out the sooty basin before
washing her hands in it, Miss Holt “smarming” her hair-net down over her little
brown chocolate of a head, and Miss Smith tearing yet another leaf out of the
inevitable book of _papiers poudrés_, the silence that met me was quite as
death-like as if the girls had just been pulled up by Mr. Dundonald’s “_Talk_-
ing, ladies!”

Talking? I didn’t need to be told that, _from_ the moment they’d seen, out of
the landing window, the last of that taxi in which the Governor and his private
clerk had driven off, _to_ the moment they had heard my returning footstep on
the stairs, they had done nothing _but_ talk about me and my incredible, my epic
lunch. As I drew the hat-pins from the admired new hat, I prepared for a
hurricane of comments and questions. None came. Not one of the girls seemed to
have a word to say to me! Perhaps they thought they would hear more by seeming
not too eager. (That’s rather Miss Robinson’s style of “drawing out” her
companions.) Perhaps they considered the subject too vast for immediate
discussion. Perhaps, for they are all good-natured girls, they had come to the
conclusion that it wasn’t fair to “rag” me about it—that I might be feeling too
utterly nervous and flurried over the unexpected (?) event. They didn’t even ask
me whether I had enjoyed myself! I even saw them, distinctly, avoid looking at
me. Only Miss Holt’s eyes seemed drawn, as if in spite of herself, to the
flowers I was taking out of my coat to put in water in the grimy jam-jar on the
dressing-table that so often holds Smithie’s bunch of violets; and it was Miss
Holt who breathed an involuntary—

“I say, what lovely carnations!”

“Do have some,” I said, as a matter of course, dividing the cluster and holding
out half to her. “Oh, no. I wouldn’t deprive you for the world, Miss Trant,”
murmured Miss Holt, stiffly drawing back. I realized from her tone that she
considered I had made a mistake. Of course! Those flowers ought to have been
thought “too precious” to share with anybody. Smithie would never think of
giving one of her “boy’s” violets away. Dear me, I thought, what an added bore,
having to remember to keep up the correctly sentimental attitude about every
trifle of this kind.... _Ah!_

I broke off what I was thinking at that moment with quite a sudden start. For,
just as she turned away, I had caught Miss Smith’s glance at that cluster of
fresh, crimson carnations. It might have been a bunch of withered wall-flowers
that had been left too long in water, for the disgusted wrinkle that lifted the
prettiest typist’s small, powdered nose. “_I_ wouldn’t touch them,” it seemed to
say. “Not _those_ flowers.” ...

And at last I saw why. The reason my three colleagues had forborne to question,
or chaff, or even look at me when I came in from that expedition with the
Governor was _not_ because they were too considerate, too puzzled, or too wily.
It was merely because they were shocked—scandalized! They were thinking worse
things of me than I thought I saw behind Lady Vandeleur’s lifted lorgnette. I
found myself suspected—probably more than suspected!—of having run counter to
the standards of a class which is perhaps more innately virtuous than Lady
Vandeleur’s and my own and Cicely’s, and certainly more rigid in its judgments.
I remembered gossip about typists and their employers, gossip from the days when
I was taking my training at Pitman’s. And out of this I could imagine for myself
the tone of the talk about me that had passed across that marble-topped table in
the “Den of Lyons” at lunch-time. “Well, Still Waters have been running deep,
with a vengeance! This is the meaning of her taking down his letters for a whole
fortnight—_without any complaints_, girls! We might have seen there was
something funny in that!”

“She’s been pretty artful, too, not letting on that there was anything at all,
until to-day!—And there must have been some sort of beginning. A girl’s boss
doesn’t take her out to a swagger lunch, with flowers and a new hat and all,
without there’s been some sort of a leading up to it!”

Perhaps Miss Robinson might suggest—“Well, I should never have thought she’d
been that kind of girl. Fact of the matter is, I suppose she funked losing her
job if she didn’t.”

But Smithie and Miss Holt would chorus vehemently, “She ought to have lost her
job, first! I would!—And chance it!”

Yes; according to this jury of maidens, I was already pronounced “_Guilty_.”

And, innocent as I was of anything they would have thought “mattered” in the
least—for I don’t think the keeping-up of a false engagement would have outraged
their conventions at all in comparison—I felt myself turn hot and cold with
shame over the false position. I was even thankful not to have to stay in the
same room with these other girls that afternoon—thankful to be able to beat a
retreat to the large, light office where I took down letters from the Governor’s
rapid dictation as if my whole life depended on it—thankful that he did make
such claims on the whole of my attention and capabilities; thankful that the
boring “dinner-partner,” who had allowed a glimpse of a slightly more human
personality in the cab when he’d discussed the difference between frocks and
furs, had been entirely swallowed up again in the business-employer. *       *
*       *       *

As he was leaving, he gave me the last of his orders for the following day. “I
should be glad if you would have lunch with me again to-morrow.”

“Very well, Mr. Waters.”

That means another ordeal in the dressing-room, where the ill-ventilated
atmosphere will again be set simmering with the unspoken—and the unspeakable. I
never did think that this ten pounds a week was going to be exactly easy to
earn. But I hadn’t bargained for this—This is outrageous! It makes me hate
everybody: Mr. Waters, to begin with, for making the proposal; Jack next, for
making it necessary for me to accept it; the girls at the office here, for so
hideously misconstruing the position! My ordinary work, which had for two or
three hours pushed my complicated “supernumerary duties” to the back of my mind,
has come to an end, and the other thing looms well into the foreground again.
I’ve walked nearly all the way back to Battersea, but that hasn’t worked off my
simmering indignation even yet. I shall spend the evening ironing out washing-
ribbon and oddments in our tiny kitchen; I can’t stay with Cicely—I should only
snap at her, and she would wonder why. The one relief that I have been able to
give to my feelings was when, in crossing the bridge, I tore those glorious
crimson carnations (which I wouldn’t leave at the Near Oriental!) out of my coat
again, and flung them far, far down into the sluggish brown waters of the river
below me. How soon they were out of sight! How I wish that I could put them and
everything connected with them, out of mind! *       *       *       *       *

To-day, the day of my second lunch with Mr. Waters, has been one that I don’t
think I shall ever forget, even when I’m a white-haired maiden-lady, with no one
to lunch with but a parrot or a tabby-cat, and no man’s “appointments” to
consult but those of the individual who has to pay me over my Old Age Pension!
Silence—a silence that ought to have rejoiced the heart of Mr. Dundonald,
reigned throughout the whole long morning. I knew that the girls meant me to
realize that Miss Trant, for outraging the code of the self-respecting business-
girl, had been “sent to Coventry.”

This was what helped me to that stiffness of spine, that Suffragette-like
defiance of eye, and that unnatural clearness of diction which I felt myself
assuming at one o’clock in the dressing-room as I announced, “I think it is at
the Savoy that I am lunching with Mr. Waters to-day.” For I flung it down like a
gauntlet. It was Miss Robinson who accepted the challenge with a particularly
icy “Gracious!”

The two others stared hard; while Miss Robinson, clearing her throat, fixed her
shrewd eyes on me and plucked up courage to add what Smithie and Miss Holt were
probably thinking. “Miss Trant! D’you mind me asking you if you’re going out
with Mr. Waters because you like it, or because you can’t say ‘No’?”

“Who would say ‘No’”—I fenced flippantly—“to a Savoy lunch?”

“Some girls might,” murmured Miss Smith. Miss Robinson, answering not my words,
but my tone, said, “Of course it’s none of my business—except that while you’re
here you are supposed to be one of us. And I can’t say——”

“Can’t say what?” I demanded, meeting her shrewd eyes squarely with my defiant
ones. She flushed a little, and I was glad. But she stuck to her guns. “I can’t
say that it looks any too well! A man in his position, and a girl in yours!
Under those circumstances——”

“You know nothing,” I said, deliberately and coldly, “about the circumstances.”

Still more deliberately I tossed a glance into the inevitably soap-splashed
mirror at the set of my hat. Then, without another word, I turned out of the
open door and walked to the lift, humming a tune just loud enough for them all
to hear. This time I didn’t trouble to glance up from the entrance, where my
employer joined me, to the landing window. The girls would not be watching me
off this time. *       *       *       *       *

“Savoy!”

The taxi-driver touched his peaked cap with a quite unusual suggestion of
deference. I suppose he had found Savoy luncheon-escorts were generous tippers.
I wondered if he had ever before driven a couple in quite these “circumstances.”

Miss Robinson’s sincerely-meant reproof, “_It doesn’t look any too well! A girl
in your position. A man in his!_” echoed in my ears louder than the whirring of
the wheels and the noise of the traffic. It rankled poisonously throughout the
drive, throughout the whole luncheon. We lunched outside, which Mr. Waters said
laconically would be “more amusing for me than inside.” Personally I felt that
nothing would ever amuse me less than this duty-lunch with its hateful
obbligato-accompaniment of what those other girls were thinking, what they were
saying. Oh, it’s all very well to quote that French axiom—

“_They say—What do they say?—Let them say!_” The average person will always find
that a counsel of perfection.—Especially the average girl. The impulse _not_ to
let them “say” if we can help it is nearly as strong in us as the instinct of
self-preservation, and of touching our hair when we pass a mirror. So that there
must be some really important basic reason for it. I do wish I knew what would
happen if that suddenly crumbled away ...? But it isn’t “away” yet: it spoiled
every trace of amusement that I might otherwise have enjoyed in the lunch and
the people that passed. I’ve merely a vague impression of cab-whistles, of taxis
whirling up beyond the trellis of the low balustrade, of obviously American
figures appearing and disappearing among the evergreens; of a small, unhappy-
looking face with dark eyes that stared resentfully at me out of the bowls of
spoons, and of a voice that said half-absently, “I’m afraid you’ve made a very
poor lunch, Miss Trant.”

“Oh, not at all.”

“Perhaps you are tired?”

“Oh, not in the least, thank you.”

“Not too tired to come on somewhere? I thought if you didn’t mind”—this always
preludes an order—“we’d drive to Gemmer’s in Bond Street, and choose that ring
for you.”

“Ring?” I repeated vaguely, as I put on my gloves. “You will have to have one,
you know. An engagement ring, as the outward and visible sign of the new
conditions,” he said nonchalantly, as we rose. “Must have a ring to clinch the
effect!”

Yes, I thought resentfully, that “clinches” it—for him. He doesn’t think of my
side of the affair at all! He doesn’t see that his accurately mapped-out time-
table includes any unpleasantness—just because _he_ doesn’t choose to admit it!
I turned to him as we sat in the cab. I felt like “the turning worm” as I pulled
myself together for what I meant to say. CHAPTER VII

CHOOSING THE RING

“About that—engagement ring, Mr. Waters——”

“Yes?”

“You want me to take to wearing it, as soon as you have got it, I suppose?”

“That’s the idea,” he said, turning a little to look at me while I stared
straight at the big white-and-blue buses lumbering up the Strand, but saw,
clearer than the traffic, the faces of Miss Robinson, Miss Holt, and Smithie
wearing that partly contemptuous, but more angry, expression with which I
suppose a decent Trades-Unionist on strike might be entitled to look down upon a
blackleg. “Yes, of course it’s for you to wear at once. What else?”

“And—to show the others?”

“Of course!” He looked still more surprised; a little impatient, too. I suppose
he felt that again an irritating spoke was being thrust into the well-oiled
wheel of his plan. “I am to show it to them and let them know, in that way, that
I am supposed to be engaged to you?”

He answered this with another question. “Tell me, Miss Trant, have you been
having any unpleasantness in the office about this—coming out to lunch with me?”

“N-no,” I said. “Of course,” I added more quickly, “it’s been awkward! You could
not expect it _not_ to have been awkward—at least, for me!”

“Ah? Made awkward for you by those girls—what?”

“No! Oh, no!” I fibbed swiftly. For again I could conclude his comment with that
relentless “_Well, then, they can go!_” And I couldn’t have the girls sacked,
calmly as I felt I could have seen them all three strangled an hour before.
“Only—a little difficult to explain.”

“This will explain it,” said my employer coolly, as the taxi stopped outside the
glass door of the great jeweller’s. A page-boy in green-and-silver swung it open
for us. And Mr. Waters made me precede him into the softly-carpeted shop with
the long glass counters and the white velvet stands curved to the shape of a
woman’s neck, on which winked and flashed, gleamed and glowed,
diamonds—rubies—pearls—jewels of every description. “The sight of flowers
soothes and softens a woman’s mood. Jewels, on the other hand, stimulate, excite
and irritate her. Possibly because they generally signify longings unattainable
combined with the knowledge that, given _that_ necklace, or gems like those, or
_such_ a pair of ear-rings, and any beauty she has would be tenfold increased.”
... That is how Sydney Vandeleur explained it to me. He’s interested in jewels
ever since he won that Arts and Crafts competition for the design of a girdle in
silver, mother-o’-pearl, and peridot. And Cicely, of the red curls, once
confessed that she would marry an octogenarian if he could give her a really
lovely rope of black pearls! But that was in fun. This was business....

A small, olive-faced shopman in a frock-coat and with curls like a retriever’s
back bowed over the counter and flashed his teeth at us. Mentally I nicknamed
him Mr. Levi Smarm. It would have taken all Miss Robinson’s powers of mimicry to
reproduce the suavity of his “Sir? What may I have the pleasure?”

“We want to see some rings,” said my employer brusquely. “Engagement rings, sir,
of course?”

“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Waters, fixing a cold granite-grey stare just above
the retriever’s back—or rather, the jeweller’s head. “Now—”

I felt that he had nearly rapped out his usual “Now, Miss Trant!” but checked
himself under the sympathetically intrusive eye of that Jewish salesman as he
turned to me—“what stones do you prefer?”

“I? Oh! What does it matter?—I mean, I don’t mind in the least!”

I was remembering things that various girl-friends had told me, in the old days,
of the choosing of their engagement rings; of various rings I had seen. One
girl, whose _fiancé_ had gipsy blood in his veins, had chosen a gipsy’s silver
wedding-ring. Another had a tiny enamel circlet with the posy:

“_The Gift is Small_     _But Love is All._”

If I _were_ the falling-in-love type of girl, which thank goodness I’m not, this
scene at Gemmer’s, so utterly opposed to all canons of Romance and tradition,
might have seemed a “desecration”—might have got thoroughly on my nerves. But
what _was_ on my nerves, which actually were jangled enough for the moment,
was—first, the attitude of the girls towards me ever since I came back from the
Carlton yesterday—and, secondly, the Governor’s blind tactlessness, his
intention of turning me loose among them, so to speak, alone, to flaunt his ring
on my finger! A positive rage against Still Waters boiled up in me as suddenly
as hot milk in the saucepan when you don’t watch it. So, when he suggested,
casually, “Let us say diamonds, then, shall we?” I heard myself retort quickly,
almost before I knew what I meant:

“Yes, diamonds. Diamonds are always money afterwards, you know!”

As soon as it was out of my mouth I realized that it was an appalling thing to
say under any circumstances. Mr. Levi Smarm, however, seemed to consider it an
extremely witty remark. He threw back his curly head and laughed quite
pleasantly as he suggested that surely the young lady was not thinking of an
“afterwards” already? “It is always well to be provided for every contingency,”
put in Mr. Waters dryly. “I should like to see those diamond rings in that show-
case over there, please.”

“There” was at the other end of the shop—which meant that our salesman had to
turn his frock-coated back upon us, and that he was out of earshot of the next
remarks between his “newly-engaged” customers. “Miss Trant!”—the Governor spoke
curtly and hurriedly—“What was your meaning just now when you said that
‘diamonds were always money afterwards’?”

“Well—I—I understood that they were! Perhaps I ought not to have said it with
the man there. I meant that you would not lose anything on it when I return that
ring to you in a year’s time from now!”

“Who said anything about ‘returning’ the ring when the so-called engagement is
up?” asked Mr. Waters, looking directly at me. I was aghast. “But ... naturally
I send it back!”

“I had not intended that at all. You will have ... expenses connected with this
affair—railway-journeys, and so on, I mean.” He _meant_ clothes again, I
suspect, but could not say so. “I intended whatever value the ring might have to
stand for those.”

“Thank you,” I said, nearly boiling up again. “In that case I won’t have
diamonds, please.”

“This is a very pretty design, madam,” insinuated the returning Mr. Smarm. “The
colour of these stones is very beautiful.”

“Yes, but I don’t think I’m going to have diamonds,” I persisted, feeling quite
amazed at my own boldness. I meant, however, to carry my point. “I’d rather have
pearls—or opals——”

“Very seldom a young lady chooses opals for her engagement ring,” smiled the
shopman. “That superstition against opals loses our firm thousands of pounds’
business a year; the majority of ladies considering them so unlucky.”

“I am not superstitious,” I said. “I would like—I am going to have an opal ring,
with very small stones in it.”

“We are going to have diamonds,” remarked my employer quietly. “Fetch me some
other diamond rings to look at.”

“I would rather not have them,” I urged, in the temporary absence of the black
curls and white teeth. “And I would rather that you had,” ordered my employer.
“After all, diamonds are the show-stones; everybody notices them. They look so
unmistakably _like_ an engagement, don’t you see?”

“Yes—I see,” I said reluctantly, my nerves feeling more jangled than ever. “But,
Mr. Waters, if I must have them, I shall insist upon sending back that ring
when——”

“When the time comes we can discuss that,” the Governor cut me short just as Mr.
Levi Smarm bent over us with his wave-offering of jewels on a tray. “Yes. That’s
a good one, that big fellow with the stones going nearly all round. Those seem a
fine colour.”

“A perfect colour, sir; perfectly matched. I am sure that you will——”

“Try it on,” said Mr. Waters, holding the winking, flashing circlet out to me. I
pulled off my left-hand glove, but here the suave shopman, evidently accustomed
to shopping couples who showed more appreciation of his sympathy and
understanding, interposed again. “Oh, pardon me, sir, but that will never do.
That would be most incorrect! No young lady would keep on an engagement ring
that had not been first slipped on to her finger by her _fiancé_ himself!”

Mr. Waters’ glance of contempt at the shopman would have shrivelled up the
entire staff at the Near Oriental. But several little things had shown me
already that the man who is a Grand Mogul in his own offices can go down several
degrees in importance when he leaves the City. Mr. Levi Smarm met that glance
with another flashing smile, and evidently waited for us to take this last hint
on bridal or betrothal etiquette as it was meant. I believe Mr. Waters was going
to do so. A slight shrug of his broad, sloping shoulders seemed to say, “We may
as well have everything _en règle_ while we’re about it,” as he turned to me.
But I wasn’t going to have any masquerading “frills” about this business that
could possibly be avoided, and this particular development in our “romance”
_was_ avoidable. I said very quickly and decidedly, “Oh, but I don’t believe in
anything of _that_ sort, you know.” Then quietly I took the ring, before he knew
what I was about, out of my employer’s hand, and slipped it on to my own
“wedding-finger.”

There was a faint purple smudge off a new ribbon on my knuckle just above the
ring. I couldn’t help thinking how entirely characteristic of the whole affair
this was: the stain of my daily labour, showing side by side with these
wonderful stones—that must also be worn as part of the gaining of my daily
bread. The ring fitted as if measured for me. “You wish me to keep this?” I said
briskly to the Governor. “Yes, I think that one will do perfectly,” he replied;
and he turned to the young jeweller again. It was to ask the price, I knew. I
was seized with that ineradicable feeling of distress that claims a woman under
any circumstances whatsoever—when mention is made of payment for her, by
another. She loves to be paid for—with all thought of price ignored. So I rose
and turned to bend over another glass counter under which gleamed pendants of
pearls and emeralds—which I scarcely saw, for another couple had strayed into
the shop—a plainish girl, simply and rather dowdily dressed; a man like dozens
of others—and they interested me. Their two faces were as radiant as if they had
come into a fortune sufficient to buy up the whole of Gemmer’s six times over,
but I heard the girl whisper, awe-struck and ecstatic, “Oh, Harry, _no_! I
_won’t_ let you! It’s _absurd_, for people like us.” ...

“People like us aren’t going to be married every day! Considering I nearly
wrecked my constitution and made myself unspeakably ill-tempered by giving up
smoking for eight months,” growled the young man, “just to save up enough to
_be_ absurd, you won’t catch me wasting it on being _sensible_.”

“I’ll write you out the cheque now, and wait while you ring up my bank, then,”
the Governor’s voice was saying; then came purrs from Mr. Levi Smarm, of “Shall
not detain you a moment, sir ... Thank you, sir; perfectly all right. Much
obliged. _Good_ afternoon, sir” (with a bend to the waist). “Good _afternoon_,
madam” (with an even lower bend). Then he turned the eyes and teeth and curls on
the young couple who had saved up to be “absurd.” I wondered whether he would
notice the difference between them and—his last customers. Probably. Ah, but he
could hardly be expected to know quite _what_ it was! “I hope,” said Mr. Waters,
civilly, on our way back to the office, “that that little Hebrew bounder didn’t
annoy you. That sort of thing is all part of his business, you understand.”

“Of course I understand,” said I submissively. “I am glad you—didn’t mind it,”
said Mr. Waters. I longed to be able to retort, “_Mind?_ Why on earth should I?
Please try to understand that there’s no reason I need ‘mind,’ any more than one
of those curved white velvet stands at Gemmer’s should mind whose hand clasps
and unclasps the necklace of amethysts and peridots that it displays. I’m quite
content to let my finger be a ‘stand,’ to show off these diamonds, for which—for
some unexplained reason—you’ve got to pay someone to be the ‘official’ wearer!
All I ‘mind’ is the way you do these things—it’s clumsy beyond belief!”

One comfort that remains to me is that I need only wear this hateful ring of his
while I _am_ on show—and not at other times. No tightly-corseted Victorian has
ever so longed to be alone in her bedroom again and undo her torturing case of
whalebone and coutil as I shall long to get away, every time I’m wearing this
“engagement” ring—to the mere pleasure of taking it off! CHAPTER VIII

THE ENGAGEMENT IS ANNOUNCED! “Ten past three, by Jove; later than I thought
again,” muttered my employer as we reached the office again. “And I’ve got all
those letters to get through yet.... Miss Trant, I shall have to ask you to come
straight through to my room, please, and take these down at once, as I’m off
early this afternoon.”

So, still in my hat and coat, I walked straight through to Mr. Waters’ own
office, sat down at the clerk’s table, and stripped off my gloves to the
afternoon’s work. (It’s alarming to see how “twice-on” white gloves become
impossible in London. I’m afraid quite a lot of my hard-earned ten pounds a week
will go on those items alone, now that I’m constrained to lunch at these haunts
of the well-dressed!) All through the stress of following the Governor’s top-
speed dictation with my scurrying shorthand, I was conscious of the bulge of
that newly-bought ring—heavy as a door-knob, it seemed now!—on my engagement
finger, and shooting its arrogant glances of orange and emerald and rose-colour
over the dull pages of my pad. I was glad that it had not had to be displayed at
once in the dressing-room; glad of the respite of my hour’s toil. But that
seemed to come to an end before I had even begun to set my teeth, mentally, to
the next ordeal. —“_and beg to remain, gentlemen, yours, etc._—Yes; that’ll do,
Miss Trant, thank you,” came the Governor’s dismissal. I put back my chair and
stood up. Now for it! Now for the announcement of this engagement! I supposed
that I need not _begin_ by saying a word to those three other girls. I should
only have to walk over to my typing-table, sit down and open my machine, and the
flash of the electric light on those marvellous stones above the keyboard would
draw three pair of eyes upon me at once. Should I have to answer that clamouring
gaze, or would the girls put it into questions of so many words? “Miss
Trant?—Look, girls!—I say, tell us, tell us? It’s not a joke? It’s an engagement
ring all right? You’re not trying to have us on, now? Are you going to tell
us——?”

Whichever way it happened, it was going to be perfectly awful. Never mind. It
had got to be. It was part of the price of that five hundred pounds, of Jack’s
salvation. “What’s the matter, Miss Trant?” asked the Governor, with a quick
glance up at me as I passed his chair. “Nothing, thank you. I am going to let
the others know, now, about this”—I moved that detested ring on my hand into
another challenging flash. “And I suppose you will require me to-morrow at lunch
again?”

“No—yes—that is——About telling the others of this engagement of ours,” took up
Mr. Waters unexpectedly. “Would you, by any chance, prefer that I did that
myself?”

_Would_ I? I nearly gasped with relief! Why couldn’t he have seen before what a
difference this would make to the situation? There isn’t much dignity in it,
goodness knows. But this would save some appearance of it, at all events! I said
quietly, “If it is the same to you, I certainly should prefer it.”

“Then please wait here while I see them. I won’t keep you a moment,” said Still
Waters, and he walked quickly out of the room. It seemed an hour to me, but I
suppose the minute-hand of the round-topped clock on the broad marble
mantelpiece had only moved on two steps before the door opened again to admit my
employer. “That’s all right,” he told me, with his succinct nod. “I have
announced the ‘engagement’ to the three other typists, and shall let Mr.
Dundonald and Mr. Alexander know before I leave. I won’t keep you, Miss Trant.
Good afternoon.”

“Good afternoon,” I said. “Thank you.”

For the first time in my life I really felt like thanking him. And yet he’d only
done the most ordinary thing that one would expect the most ordinary man to take
as a matter of course. Only the custom-honoured practice of the Near Oriental is
to refuse to regard its head as an ordinary man. Of course, he _isn’t_. There
are advantages in making a presupposition of this kind, perfectly clear from the
very start! Feeling comparatively at ease and my own mistress again, I entered
the typists’ room with my head as high as it had been when I marched out to the
lift at lunch-time after Miss Robinson’s voicing of what they all thought of me.
Miss Robinson, with her shrewd face startled into the likeness of someone much
younger and less astute, broke away from the other two—they had been all three
chattering and knotted up together in the corner by the cupboard where the tea-
things are kept—and came frankly towards me. “Well, Miss Trant! _Here’s_ some
news we’ve just had sprung on us,” said she, speaking as if she found great
difficulty in sorting out her words. “I must say—well, really! Gracious! Are you
going to shake hands and let us congratulate you, as I suppose is the right
thing, or are you feeling wild with me about this morning? We didn’t know, you
know. We never dreamed——! How was anyone to guess, after all——!”

“Of course you couldn’t,” I said, shaking hands with one after the other. “And
of course I’m not feeling ‘wild!’” My revenge was to hand if I wanted it. But
somehow I didn’t feel it would be worth it, now. Though, as a matter of fact,
the reminder of what I had felt that morning had brought some of it surging back
over me again. And this feeling was not improved by the wording of little Miss
Holt’s felicitations. “‘Wild?’ I should think Miss Trant was ready to pat
herself on the back for the next week, eh? Who’d ’a thought of this, that day we
were all trying to buck her up at lunch when she was afraid she was going to get
the sack? Didn’t I say then, though, that Miss Trant would do all right because
she’d got a taking way with men? But—the Governor himself—that we never did look
upon as just a ‘man!’ Well, you never can tell!”

“I shall never try to, after _this_ afternoon,” announced Miss Robinson. “Not
after his marching in at that door there, and saying, in quite a human sort of
voice—not his own voice at all—that is, you’ll excuse me, Miss Trant! You know
what I mean!—saying, ‘_I have some news to tell you ladies. Miss Trant and I are
engaged to be married!_’”

“Married to the head of the firm—my hat!” breathed Miss Holt, devouring me with
her eyes, as if she thought that by staring hard enough she might discover the
secret of how one achieved this giddy height. “Too grand to speak to any of us
after this! Look at that ring of hers! Think of all _that_ means!”—

Yes! If she only could! —“No more turning out to get to business every morning,
wet or dry, with the mud still stiff on your skirt that you haven’t had time to
brush! No more lining up with the crowd to wait for that beastly old workman’s
tram at the ‘Elephant!’ No more strap-hanging! No more packed motor-buses with
flower-women, and goodness knows what, shoving their baskets into you and
trampling on your feet as they get in!” She took breath, and then, for fear one
of the others should interrupt before she finished this harangue upon the
Dignity of Labour, she hurried on—“No more having to keep on at it if you _are_
ready to drop and your eyes popping out of your head—no more A.B.C. girls not
taking the slightest notice of your order and _then_ giving you sauce because
you’ve waited half an hour for your lunch—no more slaving from har’-past nine to
six for _her_ any more!... I suppose you know you’re _most awfully lucky_?”

“In some ways,” murmured Miss Smith softly. “But having stacks of money and
never having to work again isn’t _everything_!”

And the dreamy look that came into her eyes irritated me worse than the loudly-
expressed envy of the other girl. Miss Holt’s type of mind, that cares only for
the things that she can see and handle and wear and eat and drink, _is_ so much
easier to tackle than an _un_-practical person’s point of view. I’m glad I’m
rather like Miss Holt, myself. These sentimental people are too tiresome! I
simply couldn’t help one snap at Miss Smith as I turned to her. “I suppose
_nothing’s_ ‘everything’ except wasting _years_ waiting for Love in a flat? I
suppose you despise any hard-up girl who’s sick of the struggle and who marries
for comfort and a home?”

“I don’t despise anybody, Miss Trant, as it happens!” protested Smithie, facing
me with the sudden defiance of a mild nature touched in its tenderest spot.
“_You_ didn’t ought to speak sarcastically to me, just because _you_ can get
married at once instead of waiting—years—till he can afford——”

“Well, and you needn’t despise me for that other reason, at all events,” I said,
a little mollified by the tears that were now welling up in the dreamy eyes,
“for, whatever else I may be going to do, Miss Smith, I am not going to marry
Mr. Waters for his money!”

I didn’t add that I shouldn’t ever marry him at all, but that his money was
quite good enough to get engaged to him on. However, had I openly announced
this, I don’t think she could have looked more surprised. “Not for his
money—marry him for _love_, then? _Him?_” screamed little Miss Holt before she
could stop herself. Then she clapped her hand over her wide-open mouth, another
involuntary gesture, caused partly, I suppose, by the impulse to keep back
anything further that might offend me, and partly by the appearance at the door
of Mr. Dundonald. It was to everybody’s amazement that this was not immediately
followed by the inevitable “_Talk_-ing, ladies!” and the scowl. But an extensive
smile creased Mr. Dundonald’s shut fist of a face into unfamiliar lines of
benevolence; he beamed upon us all as he announced in a voice as suavely
unfamiliar as the smile, “Miss Trant! I am sorry to interrupt your conversation,
but Mr. Waters would be much obliged if you would go back to his room again for
a moment, as he wishes to say a few words to you!”

“Oh, certainly,” I said, wondering what in the world this additional “order”
might be. The girls didn’t “wonder.” I know they thought it was for another
good-bye—especially Smithie, one-idea’d simpleton! I felt her demure little
smile in the small of my back as I turned to the door. Mr. Dundonald—oh,
unprecedented occurrence!—held it open for me, murmuring, as I passed out, “Miss
Trant! May I be permitted to proffer my very heartiest good wishes on the
occasion of this—this delightful announcement?”

“Oh! Thank you so much,” I said pleasantly. (“Worm!” I thought.) So the Governor
had told Mr. Dundonald while I was receiving the congratulations of my
colleagues.... I saw in his eye—grey, fishy, and always looking as if “the Main
Chance” were plainly visible just ahead of any person he addressed—that already
my personality had changed from that of the twenty-five-shillings-a-week typist,
clad in her “all-I’ve-got” serge costume and liable to dismissal at his hands,
to that of young Mrs. William Waters, who, gorgeous in silk, satin and sables,
would one of these days be calling at the office to pick up the head of the firm
and to motor him home with her! Mr. Dundonald’s new manner was a forecast of his
reception of me when that day should dawn! If _he_ only knew! “Sorry to trouble
you again,” said the Governor as I presented myself before him once more. “I
forgot, in the middle of all that other business”—this, I suppose, might have
applied to either the dictating of his letters, or the choosing of his betrothal
ring—“to tell you that I intend to let my mother know, to-night, about this
engagement of ours.”

“Oh, yes.”

“You will probably hear from her to-morrow, inviting you to stay at our
house—it’s near Sevenoaks. You had better send in your formal resignation to the
office at once, and make your arrangements to come on for a fortnight’s visit or
so, in a few days. Will that be convenient to you?”

“Oh, perfectly,” I said obediently, hoping that I did not show any outward
symptoms of that sick feeling of panic that possessed me. To stay at the
Governor’s house? So soon? Horrors! With the Governor’s mother? What _will_ she
be like? Exactly like him, probably, only far more forbidding; women can always
be more alarming than even the most terrifying of men. An elderly feminine
edition of Still Waters! Ye gods! And she will hate me, of course; look upon me
as that designing minx of a typist who had “got round” her son in business-hours
and prevented him from “doing well for himself” in some other direction. People
with money always want their children to marry people with more! It will be Lady
Vandeleur over again, only worse. How appalling! Perhaps she will make herself
as disagreeable to me as possible, in the hope of inducing me to feel that I
should never be able to stand such a mother-in-law, and that I should simply
have to break it off!—which, under the circumstances, I’m powerless to do!
“And—er—that will be all, this afternoon, thank you. You will hand your notes of
my letters to Mr. Alexander. If you have arrangements to make, you can leave as
early as you choose to-day.”

“Thank you, Mr. Waters.”

Feeling that I couldn’t have stood another minute of him and his “arrangements,”
I walked quickly out of the room and down the passage. Round a corner, I heard
the voice of our office mimic, who had slipped out on some pretext, in full flow
of narrating to one of the telephone girls the amazing news that I know was
being buzzed all over the Near Oriental offices. —“but, my dear, the little
Trant gives out she’s madly in love with him! She says”—here a most successful
imitation of my own voice—“‘Whatever else I may be doing, I am NOT marrying him
for his money!’”

“P’raps it’s for his kind heart and his charm of manner, I don’t think,”
suggested the telephone girl. “Or his good looks, eh?”

“Nothing actually the matter with his looks, my girl. Anyhow, he does always
look as if he went in for no end of cold water, and week-end tramps, and golf,
and the windows wide open, and decent soap—cuticura, I’ve smelt it,” said Miss
Robinson. “And as if he could _heave_ things—which nobody else does, in this
establishment. And if you _can_ get over the general effect of ‘the stern-and-
solemn-Nelson’s column——’”

“Well, I can’t. But she’s quite pretty if she’d only make a little more _of_
herself; p’raps she will now,” said the telephone girl, who wears long coral
drop-earrings and pins brown-paper cuffs over her sleeves in business-hours.
“What on earth do you suppose he said when he proposed to her?”

“‘_Now, Miss Trant, when you have taken down that Buenos Ayres order, there is
something I have to consult you about personally. Now, Miss Trant, are you
prepared to consider_——’”

It was so exactly our employer’s voice that I, standing there unnoticed, burst
out laughing. The girls, caught out, laughed too. “You didn’t know you were the
talk of the place, did you, Miss Trant? May as well make up your mind to it,”
said Miss Robinson. “And do show Miss Harris your ring!”

“I could see it from here. I thought it was something being done to the electric
lights. My! but they are sparklers! I shouldn’t half swank, wearing jewellery
like this. Did you choose it to-day, Miss Trant? My word! Some people do have
all the luck. It’ll be a very short engagement, I presume?”

“I don’t think so,” said I, thinking of the nearly twelve complicated and weary
months that stretched before me. “Some time yet.”

“No doubt any time’ll seem long _na-ow_,” said the telephone girl archly. “Can’t
you tell us _about_ when it’s likely to be?”

Oh, dear! It seemed to me as if I passed through hours of this sort of thing
before I could break away and set out for Battersea and our bachelor-girl flat.
Wearily, and without any “spring” left in me, I climbed the four flights of
stone steps. I felt positively dragged down by the thought of that awful
fortnight with the Governor’s mother at their house near Sevenoaks. It had clung
to me all the way back. Only as I put my key into the door did I remember
something else. There would be Cicely to break the news of my engagement to,
now! CHAPTER IX

THE LOVER WHO CAME TOO LATE

But here, in our flat, I found to my amazement that someone had been before me
with the news. Cicely’s marigold-coloured hair and flushed face reared
themselves up excitedly from the faded couch cushions as I came in. “I say!
_Tots!_ What’s all this?—Look here, what _is_ the meaning of it?” she cried
breathlessly. “What’s this wild story about you being engaged to be married? Do
say it isn’t true;—it can’t be! is it?”

“Who in the world,” I demanded, standing by our rickety old table in the middle
of the room and staring at her as she sat up leaning on her elbow, “told you
anything about it?”

“Well, who d’you suppose? Who would?”

I glanced quickly at the tray on the table, crowded with the _débris_ of what
had been tea for two, one saucer piled high with cigarette-ends that told their
own tale. Who had been? One of Cicely’s Slade girls? But how would _they_ know?
Whoever it was must have stayed _hours_! “It was your friend”—Cicely announced
this even as the cork hurls itself from an unwired bottle of champagne—“Mr.
Sydney Vandeleur!”

“Sydney—he’s been here?”

“Well, of course!”

“What on earth for?”

“What _for_, Tots? Why, to see _you_! And, I say! How awfully charming and
clever and delightful he is! And so handsome! Such a real artist’s head, I call
it! _Exactly_ like a Vandyke of Charles the First! Oh, my dear! _Don’t_ tell me
you’ve gone and got engaged to somebody else, when there’s such a really
_wonderful_ person so desperately in love with you!”

“Who says he’s in love with me?”

“Why, he does, of course. Didn’t you _know_? You must have. _Didn’t_ you?”

“N-no.”

Slowly I dropped my gloves and umbrella and vanity-bag and paper on to the
table. Of course I have “known,” at the back of my mind, all the time about
Sydney. But however positive a girl may be that a man cares for her, _until he’s
told her so she’s never certain_. This may sound Irish—to a man. Any _girl_
understands....

To hear the fact proclaimed by Cicely’s lips—which really, I do believe, would
blurt out anything that came into her red head!—gave me the same shock of
surprise that it would have done even if I’d never received little attentions
from Sydney, never heard his neatly-turned compliments, never seen those
handsome brown eyes of his fixed upon me in unmistakable admiration, or noticed
the blank mask that had suddenly fallen over them yesterday, when I broke to the
Vandeleurs the news of my so-called engagement. Cicely went on with her tale,
enjoying it thoroughly. “My dear Tots, you must have known. He’s wanted to marry
you ever since you were a slip of a schoolgirl with a little proud pearl of a
face and that lovely dark hair of yours in a great mane down to your waist. Even
then he always meant to propose to you.”

“And he tells _you_ that? Not me?”

Here I sat down suddenly in the elbow-chair with the one arm “that’s always
a-comin’ off, drat it!” as Mrs. Skinner says. It came off now. “_Drat_ it!” I
quoted, through my teeth, and hurled the broken arm into a corner with a
violence that did some—not much—good to my feelings. “He never told me, Cicely.”

“Because he was too tactful, too nice. He’d too much fine feeling,” she
explained eagerly. “He couldn’t possibly ask you so soon after the ‘smash’ in
your affairs, and after Colonel Trant’s death, and all. It _would_ have looked
too much as if he were taking advantage of that to rush the position. He
determined to wait until you—until he—well, to wait,” said Cicely. “He saw I was
sympathetic; he didn’t mind telling me all this. But he was going to ask you
when he and his mother came back from abroad. All the time, he was simply
longing to come and carry you off bodily from that hateful typewriter where he
kept thinking of you chained, he said, like Andromeda (who _was_ she, exactly?)
to her rock. Only he just wouldn’t. Wasn’t it _sweet_ of him, Tots!”

“To wait and tell all this to another girl?”

“But it was you he was coming round to tell!”

“He didn’t stop to see me.”

“He _had_ to get back to Belgrave Square and dress for a theatre-party of his
mother’s.”

“What he came for at all, after yesterday, I don’t see!”

“It was _about_ yesterday he came to see you, Tots! You see, he says he met you,
and you seem to have made him understand that you were engaged to be married.”

“Well? Didn’t he believe me? Did he come round here and sit here filling the
place with that abominable reek of Egyptian cigarettes—and, yes! finishing _all_
that nice peach jelly I got in specially for you—to find out whether it was
true?”

“Is it true, then?” gasped Cicely. “_Yes!_ I told him so. I told Lady Vandeleur
so. I am engaged.”

“And not—to _him_!” Cicely seemed utterly unable to grasp how this could be.
“What? After all he’s said—and _with_ his photograph on your dressing-table—not
that it’s nearly good enough for him! And after what I told him I hoped——”

“What DID you tell him?” I groaned resignedly. Cicely twisted the long, slender
figure, upon which her equally slender salary as a mannequin depends, into a
more comfortable curve against the cushions. “Well! _Poor_ Mr. Vandeleur! When
he said he’d seen you lunching at the Carlton alone with a young man, I told him
it must be a mistake. You never _did_ lunch there, or with young men. It was
just what I admired you for, when it’s _so_ easy to get into the other way of
being rather nice to people just for the sake of their giving you a good time
and a change from being at work all day! And even though you’re not a bit stuffy
with me because I sometimes do it, you——”

“Never mind me. What did he say?”

“He said: ‘But how _could_ there be a mistake? She brought up this self-
satisfied-looking individual and introduced him to my mother as her _fiancé_.
She let us congratulate him!’ I said, ‘Well, but she hasn’t _got_ a _fiancé_—or
I should have known about it! I’ve never heard a syllable. She didn’t even tell
me she was going out to lunch. She must have been taken out at a moment’s
notice—by a friend of Jack Trant’s, perhaps. Or,’ I said, ‘it may have been
someone she absolutely had to meet, on business!’” she continued vaguely—much
she knows about business!—“‘Getting a better post, or something of that sort.
And when she met you unexpectedly, she was flurried, and didn’t know how to
explain. Is your mother rather particular, or strait-laced?’ Mr. Vandeleur said,
‘Very, I am afraid!’ So I said, ‘Well, that’s what must have happened!—Tots, in
her nervousness, and not wishing your mother to be shocked, just blurted out
‘_fiancé_’——”

“Thank you,” I muttered. “I didn’t know _I_ was a blurter-out!”

“You mean _I_ am! I daresay! Well, I don’t care! I thought that _must_ have been
it—I didn’t see what else it could have been! And the poor man was so thirsting
to hear anything I could tell him about you, that I should have been a brute not
to!” declared my chum, plaintively defiant. “So I just said everything I
could—about that photograph, and all!”

“What photograph?” I snapped. “Why, that one of Mr. Vandeleur. I recognized him
from that, the moment Mrs. Skinner let him in. And I told him that it was the
one and only portrait of a young man that you seemed to possess, and that you
always keep it in a silver frame beside your looking-glass. Now, Tots, you can’t
say you don’t!”

No; I couldn’t. “And that cheered him up so, poor fellow! He said—Oh, _isn’t_ it
a tragedy?” interpolated Cicely with zest—“that I’d given him fresh hope to go
away with!”

“Fresh fiddlesticks,” I muttered, still more savagely. “You mean there isn’t
any?”

“I mean,” I explained as patiently as I could, “that a girl can’t be engaged to
two men at once.”

“Then _who’s_ this other, Tots, that you’ve never said a word about? He can’t
possibly be fit to hold a candle to—I mean, who _is_ it?”

“It is the managing director and head of the firm where I’ve been working,” I
told her bluntly. “His name is Mr. William Waters.”

“_What?_ Not the man you all call ‘_Still Waters_’? The one you all detest,
who’s so impossible to please? Engaged to him? Oh, now you’re pretending! Tell
me, Tots. Of course you are only joking, after all?”

A nice idea of “joking” my chum has got! “_Does_ this look like a joke?” I
demanded suddenly. The newly-bought diamonds flashed under her widely-opened
eyes. “Don’t you admire my engagement ring, Cis?”

Cicely Harradine’s soft bud of a face faded from pink to pale, and her big eyes
clouded dolefully. She said nothing for a moment but “Oh, Tots!” (she’s quite as
hopeless as Miss Smith). Then, in a tone of the timidest reproach, she faltered,
“Mr. Vandeleur _said_ he was ‘big and blonde and City-fied and extremely
prosperous-looking.’ I said I’d never seen any friend of yours who was like
that. No wonder! The head of the firm! But—Tots!—I should—should hate to think
of you, of all girls, marrying anyone because of his—money?”

“Then don’t think it. You may do me that justice!” I said sharply. She was
nearly as bad in her way as the typists at the Near Oriental had been in
theirs—and the same prevarication had to be used to “head off” _her_ comments on
a marriage for money. After which, the accusation in my chum’s big eyes melted
suddenly into tears. Impulsively she flung her slim arms round my neck—and I had
to let her. “Forgive me, Tots. Dear old girl, but how _was_ I to know? It’s all
so unexpected, and I never met him, and you never gave me a hint! I _didn’t_ see
how you could possibly prefer anyone to Mr. Vandeleur, who _is_ so wonderful!
But of course I know Love’s blind—I mean, you can’t _make_ yourself not care for
this Mr. Waters, just because another man wants so badly to marry you! Oh, Tots,
it’s all my fault, but I’m afraid he’s going to write to you about that——”

“Mr. Vandeleur is?” (This, too!) “Yes! It’s all because of what I said to him. I
have been putting my foot in it,” she admitted, as if this were quite a new idea
to me too, “but _do_ forgive me—Since you do really care for this Mr. Waters I’m
only too delighted, darling. Oh, I’m so glad for your happiness, you can’t
think! When did it happen? He’s _madly_ in love with you, of course?”

Here I thought grimly of Miss Robinson’s version: “_My dears, the little Trant
makes out she’s madly in love with him!_” All this about two people who, as far
as I can make out, have only one thing in common—both being absolutely falling-
in-love-_proof_! Poor, well-meaning, warm-hearted Cicely was still effusing;
eager to make up for her first suspicion that I _wasn’t_ engaged for the only
right reason. “I ought to have seen! Of course! It was he who gave you this
extra work about a fortnight ago?”

“Exactly!” (Extra work with a vengeance! More than I’ve bargained for!) —“And
that we were so thankful for, just when I lost my own job and was ill, and there
were all those extra things to get.... It was your ‘rise’ that got them all, I
knew. Only I didn’t know ... this other. It _began_ then, I suppose, Tots?”

“Yes, it began then.”

“How romantic! Well! And I did notice that you’ve been absent-minded and not
saying much these last few days, and I _ought_ to have known why it was.
_Especially_ yesterday. Did HE take you out to lunch again to-day? Oh, doesn’t
it make the whole world different for you?”

“It makes the menu jolly different, anyhow,” I admitted. “Ah, yes; you may
pretend to be as flippant as you like about it, but I know that’s ‘all put on’
to hide what you’re really feeling!” declared Cicely. Such a convenient
conviction! I made up my mind, then and there, that this was just the line I
should adopt with my chum. And laughing merrily for her benefit, I fled to my
own little room. *       *       *       *       *

Here, left to my own thoughts at last, I flung myself down on my creaky little
camp bedstead and raged as I reviewed this new aspect of the situation. Put
crudely, it is this: It’s not _until_ I tie myself up with this wretched sham
“engagement” to the Governor that I have the chance of cutting everything to do
with him and his odious office, and becoming safely, happily and _genuinely_
engaged! Or, in the jargon of the Near Oriental, it’s just after I’ve sold out
at a loss that I get an advantageous offer! Why on earth couldn’t Sydney
Vandeleur have said all that _before_? A year ago—even a month ago—and, to
_think_ what it would have saved! I shouldn’t have minded getting that money for
Jack—from his own brother-in-law! Yes; if he’s cared for me all this time, why
couldn’t he have proposed to and married me before I’d so much as seen that
hateful Near Oriental, with that “Andromeda’s rock” of a typewriter, watched
over by what Miss Holt calls “that Gordian” of a Governor! Why couldn’t Sydney
have hurried up, for once in his life, to play Perseus? “Too much tact!” Good
gracious! Why must men have this absurd code of ethics about “the right thing”
when there’s a _woman_ in the case? Why does a man who’s hard-up, for instance,
consider it so much more “honourable” to “ride away” without a word to the girl
whose heart he knows is his, just because he “feels he oughtn’t to propose
before he’s in a position to marry?”

He “feels he ought not to stand in the girl’s way of better offers.” ... But he
_does_ that, more often than not, with her first sight of him! Never mind. He’d
_rather_ leave her fretting her heart out for life over the belief that he was
only flirting after all, or let her make a miserable marriage with someone
else—rather than be “dishonourable” enough to own up that he cares and wants her
to wait perhaps three or four years for him. He’s saved his precious “code,”
just as I suppose Sydney wished to save his. Oh, men’s “fine feelings,” men’s
delicacy and tact, men’s sense of honour! What infinitely greater damage these
do in the world than all women’s lack of principle! That sounds sweeping, but
_isn’t_ this enough to make a girl storm at the scruples—or whatever they may
call them—which have pretty well messed up her own life for her? I ought to be
safely and happily married, by now, to Sydney Vandeleur. He’d make a charming
husband, I know; not a wish of his wife’s that he wouldn’t immediately try to
gratify, from the pattern of the drawing-room carpets to where she would wish to
live most of the time—Pont Street—Park Lane—or the perfectly gorgeous, old-
fashioned castle with all modern conveniences that he owns in Ireland—Ballycool,
they call it. Oh, for the deep sighing woods and the silver lakes over
there—miles and miles from anywhere else—scented solitude, with all the
drawbacks of solitude removed by motors _ad lib._—by big house-parties of
amusing people as often as one chose!—Yes, I suppose I do share Miss Holt’s type
of mind, but then I never pretend to be romantic, or to cherish illusions about
being able to fall in love.... I should be really, genuinely fond of Sydney
himself—I mean I _should_ have been. He’d be so devoted—how could one help
feeling pleased to have him about, approving of everything one did and said and
looked? He’s what I’d call companionable; not too lofty and masculine to take an
interest in the details that mean so much more to a woman than what this country
is coming to, by Gad, or what on earth McKenna or Asquith or someone is driving
at when he says—(here yards, droned aloud, out of the _Times_)—or whether Kent
is going to do any better this year; which is all the conversation that any
married women _I’ve_ ever met seem to get out of _their_ husbands. Sydney would
always know what anyone had had on at a party, including his wife. He’d be able
to help her think out her frocks—and what heavenly frocks they would be! Then
he’s so undeniably good-looking himself. One wouldn’t be able to help
appreciating the fact that the other women would always notice it with envy, and
would put it down as such a score to the credit of the one he’d married! His
dark, “interesting” face with the Vandyke beard and the melancholy brown eyes
seems watching me now out of the big silver frame in which he sent it to me.
Yes; it certainly does hold the place of honour on the narrow painted-pine
chest-of-drawers that has two handles missing, but is still spread with ivory-
topped brushes, a monogrammed hand-mirror and long crystal scent flagons—relics
from the wreck of the Trant fortunes!—the place of honour usually reserved in a
girl’s room for the portrait of HIM—whoever “he” may be! Why did I put it there?
Partly for the sake of old times, I suppose; I’ve tried to keep everything of
that sort which was in my room at home.... Partly to remind myself, whenever
I’ve felt extra-downhearted, that there was at least one eminently presentable
young man who was accustomed to say pretty things of the face and hair that I
saw reflected in the somewhat wavy looking-glass near by.... Sentiment, vanity,
or a mixture of both, but _not_ the motive with which Cicely had credited me and
which she’d seen fit to impart to the original. That idiot of a Sydney! If I
could hope he’d feel it, I’d smash the glass of that frame and run red-hot hat-
pins into his portrait. I have been furiously angry to-day, in turns with the
three typists, with Still Waters, and with Cicely—but none of this counts,
compared with my fury against the lover who has come too late! It’s his fault.
It’s all his fault—all that’s just happened—all that will happen during the mad
“arrangement” of this next year. And when that year’s up, where will it find me?
A little richer, perhaps, by what’s left of my desperately-won salary, but back
in the over-crowded labour-market, the world of working-women who lose looks and
youth and spirits in the struggle for daily bread. Oh, it’s all very well to be
plucky, and to treat everything as a joke, and to live from one Saturday matinée
to another, making the most of life in London as a bachelor-girl—while you’re
twenty-one. What becomes of the “bachelor-girl” of forty-five? And fifty? That,
I suppose, I shall have to wait and find out for myself, thanks to Mr. Sydney
Vandeleur! Why couldn’t he have left things as they were at the Carlton?—

But I’ve had enough of this. It has “done me up” completely. I am going to bed.
*       *       *       *       *

This morning I feel, if anything, angrier with Sydney Vandeleur than I did
before. He’s done it now! He _has_ written. His note lies before me on our
wobbly little breakfast-table with the metal coffee-pot and the green Bruges
crock full of lilac (bought out of my “rise”!) screening me from Cicely’s
anxious eyes as I read:

“_My dearest Monica_,

“_I have never called you so before. That was a mistake. Anything is a mistake
that keeps us two apart. Dear, I want to     come and see you at once, but
cannot get out of some odious     ‘arrangements’ of the Mamma’s for this week-
end._

“_Let me come on Monday afternoon, and, though I don’t deserve     it, be kind
to me then._

“_Till then, and ever_,

“_Your devoted S. V._”

Now _I_ have written; and pretty quickly too. “_My dear Sydney_,

“_It was kind of you to write to me to congratulate me again on     my
engagement to Mr. Waters, which I suppose is the meaning of     your note. You
suggest calling; is this to congratulate me for     the third time? If so, I can
only hope that my happiness will     keep pace with your good wishes for it! But
I am afraid that I     shall not be able to receive them in person on Monday, as
it     is the very day that I hope to be going off to Sevenoaks, on a     visit
to my fiancé’s mother._

“_Please give my very kindest regards to Lady Vandeleur, and     believe me_

“_Sincerely yours_,

“_Monica Trant_.”

There! CHAPTER X

“HIS” MOTHER’S INVITATION

The note of invitation from “my _fiancé’s_ mother” is purely formal and
absolutely non-committal; in fact, exactly the note I should have imagined that
a Mrs. Waters would write. I’ve got a perfectly clear mental image of this
mother of an animated tape-machine. Handsome, in a regular-profiled, stately,
mid-Victorian style, with steely grey eyes that “corkscrew” all the self-
possession out of you, and—oh, the manner! She won’t be openly disagreeable
after all, I’ve decided. Worse; she’ll be rigidly, frigidly polite; clothing in
irreproachable civilities the obvious wonder whether her son has taken leave of
his senses, to propose to one of his own employees. She writes that she looks
forward (of course!) with pleasure (_dis_-pleasure, she means) to making my
acquaintance (_will_ she!) at The Lawn (well, I suppose they can’t _call_ their
house The Sarcophagus. But that’s what it ought to be. A glorified edition of
the Governor’s private office. Marble halls and chilly statuary—brr!) on Monday
next. I expect she guesses that “this Miss Trant,” or “that young woman,” or
“the horrid little typist-person,” or whatever she calls me in her own mind,
will be rather overwhelmed by the prospect; and no doubt Mrs. Waters means to
see that I shall continue being overwhelmed—“kept in my place,” indeed—during
the whole of the fortnight that the Governor specified. But she can’t realize
the positive panic with which I anticipate the meeting. And, if I can steel
myself to help it, she _shall not_ realize it. “I should think you can hardly
wait until you get there, Tots,” said Cicely, watching me pack new clothes in
the new dress-basket bought specially for the dread occasion, for I’ve spent
every minute of two days in shopping. “Aren’t you _dying_ to see what everything
is going to be like?”

“I shall have to survive until to-morrow, anyhow.”

“‘His’ home! His father’s dead, you said. Is there only his mother?”

“I suppose so. Quite enough too. _I_ think all engaged men ought to be orphans
and only children before they begin, for the sake of the girl. ‘Only’ his
mother, indeed!”

“Well, she’s _bound_ to be pleased with you, Tots! You’re so pretty and ripping,
especially now you’ve got all these lovely new things. What a mercy that you had
that little windfall of a legacy just in time to let you buy all fresh!”

(This is how I’ve been obliged to account for that.) “You could go and stay
anywhere now, meet anybody! He’ll be so proud of you. It must be such a comfort
for an engaged man when he knows that his people and his friends _can see what
he means_ when he shows off his _fiancée_ to them for the first time, instead of
their wondering what on earth he finds to admire!”

“Do you think Mrs. Waters will ‘see what he means’ by his getting himself
engaged to his clerk?” I said, with a private giggle at my own bitterness. “I
wish _I_ did!”

“Now, Tots, don’t fish for any more compliments. You know how people must admire
you. Why, as Mr. Vandel—I mean, it’s so obvious! Don’t look so depressed, my
dear. Of course I suppose going to meet ‘his’ people is always a fearful ordeal,
but it ought to be less so for you than for most engaged girls!”

*       *       *       *       *

Perhaps—though Cicely doesn’t know why—_it ought_! Anyhow, these encouraging
words of my chum’s were still echoing in my ears as a late afternoon train bore
me off from Victoria towards Sevenoaks and that terrifying visit to my
(official) mother-in-law elect. For the first time since the days when it was a
matter of course for me to do so, I travelled first class. It wouldn’t do for me
to alight at Sevenoaks station under the eyes of some pompous Waters domestic,
all crumpled and dusty and warm from a compartment crowded with market-baskets
and moist babies. I am taking this man’s money to pose as his _fiancée_, and
it’s only fair to him that I should do him no discredit in any way. So I
travelled down in expensive seclusion, wearing for the first time one of my new
costumes, a real success in thick tobacco-brown silk, with a duck of a little
brown hat to match. Cicely chose that out of a big boxful “on approval” from
Madame Chérisette’s. Even without Cicely’s gratifying gush on the subject, I
can’t help knowing that the smoky-cream underlining and the trimming—a cream-
coloured feathery mount and a knot of dull-pink buds—are delightfully becoming
to a clear brunette complexion and glossy black hair. Thanks to my being an
easy-to-fit small “stock size,” I’ve got a really charming little trousseau
together at very short notice. As it’s probably the only trousseau of any sort
that I shall ever possess now (I wonder what Sydney Vandeleur thought of my
note? ), I selected it with gusto, and I mean to enjoy the wearing of every
stitch of it, from the fur-lined motor-wrap to those American-pattern nighties
that the girl in the shop said were “so sweetly bridal-looking, Moddam.”

It’s been such ages since I was able to choose and arrange a kit with garments
for separate occasions and with a definite colour-scheme; it’s so long I’ve
been, not “dressed,” but “covered”—yes! covered in patches with something in
navy-blue that I’ve managed to afford at one time; something in brown that I’ve
“had to have” at another time; something black that I’ve just “had by me.”

But now I shall be able to look “together” once more in my favourite harmonies
of soft browns, creams and pinks. A dream of mine on my way to the office has
come true at last; it’s a dream of a thick, clover-pink linen suit, with touches
of heavy creamy lace in just the right places. In just the right places, too, it
fits or falls away from me; and I don’t think even the feminine edition of Still
Waters will be able to help being _rather_ impressed by it! As for Sydney
Vandeleur, I know _he_ would have said——

*       *       *       *       *

I’ve been wondering whether after all I need have sent that curt note to Sydney?
Of course, I _was_ furious with him, first for coming too late, and secondly for
proposing at all after I was powerless to accept him—he didn’t know that; but
what a position he put me into! _Could_ I have put an end to it? (My thoughts
raced on with the train.) _Could_ I have written that very evening to Mr.
Waters, cancelling that preposterous arrangement with him, returning that lump
sum of salary, and saying——

Impossible! A hundred pounds of that salary had had to go, irrevocably, as soon
as I got it. And already I’d broken into that remaining four hundred in the
bank! I couldn’t make up even that. How would it have been if when Sydney
proposed to me, I had replied:

“_I can’t see you. I can’t even tell you anything more, yet. But wait a year,
and then ask me again_”? Since he’s “waited” _so_ long——! But no. That wouldn’t
have done either. It wouldn’t be keeping my bargain. It would be “giving away”
my compact with that other, that detestable man, who trusts after all to my
word—and after all, Sydney _has_ got himself to thank for the fact that I
haven’t been choosing a trousseau to please _him_....

*       *       *       *       *

Well! There’s nothing in _this_ outfit, I hope, that won’t pass the censorship
of the most critical glances in any big house—those of the servants. Men-
servants, I suspect, are almost harder to “impress” than maid-servants. But it
was no lordly groom or supercilious chauffeur who met me at Sevenoaks Station as
I stepped out of the train. The tall, broad-shouldered figure that strode
towards me looked, in a big, grey, loose motor-coat, so utterly different from
the mind-picture of the slimly-built, dark, Vandyke-bearded young man that had
travelled most of the way down with me, so different, too, from the other
apparition I know only too well in immaculate “City” get-up, that at first I
didn’t recognize him. Then a cap was lifted. I saw the fair hair, brushed sleek
as satin, and the keen, blonde face of my employer. Several people on the
platform were glancing at him as if he were almost as well known down here in
the country as in Leadenhall Street. Then eagerly inquisitive glances were
turned to me. I caught a whisper of “Mr. William Waters’ young lady!” I wondered
if the speaker—a prosperous-looking sort of butcher—expected to overhear some
tender greeting? How “sold” he’d have been! “Ah, there you are, Miss
Trant!”—briskly as ever. “Good afternoon. What luggage have you? Porter, bring
these things across to the car. I’m motoring you up to the house myself,” added
Mr. Waters to me, as we left the station, “because there’s a little
supplementary detail I wanted to ‘put you on to,’ so to speak, before you meet
my people.”

“Oh, yes?” I said inquiringly, and I mentally reached for my pencil and pad. But
as I sat beside him on the comfortably padded seat with a lovely rug drawn up
over my knees, and with a thick glass screen keeping my _chic_ little new hat
from getting blown about, I felt the pad-and-pencil side of my life slipping
away from me as swiftly and steadily as the green hawthorn hedges that lined the
road seemed slipping past this gliding car. I had had a brute of a time just
lately—now came the reaction. I suppose it was partly the entirely feminine
sensation, thrilling every scrap of my body, that it was once more decently
dressed! Partly, too, it was the influence of skimming over a country road
again, breathing in untainted breezes under a blue sky with rolling white
cauliflower clouds; having a whole smiling landscape to myself again!—for the
moment I lost count of _how_ this had happened. The thoughts of the last hour
were left behind with those of the last two years—with the mean streets and the
City smells and noises, and those Battersea rooms, and that utter lack of space
and privacy, and that crushing sense of being just one unit out of millions that
didn’t matter! Before I’d experienced these things, I’d lived for nineteen
years, another sort of life; and this seemed almost like coming home to it. I
felt as if I were the fish that, having been left stranded on the proverbial
gravel path, has somehow succeeded in flopping back to his native element. I
gave myself up to the luxury of the feeling—to the exhilarating rush through the
clear air. And I’d practically forgotten who was driving me, when his business-
like voice sounded once more in my ear. “Miss Trant! Your Christian name, as I
saw by your note to my mother, is Monica?”

“Yes.”

I supposed he was now going to ask me if I had any objection to his addressing
me thus as long as I was his mother’s guest. Why, of course, he’d _have_ to!
Just as I should have to bring myself to use his own name of “William.”
(“_Ahem!_ _Wil_-liam!” as Miss Robinson pronounced it pompously.) How queer to
have to be asked to accord one’s Christian name under such terms! Really, he
might have taken it as a matter of course that he must, for the next fortnight
or so, call me “Monica.” Therefore I was rather taken aback by his next remark.
“I shall have to ask you if you would mind very much, while you are staying at
The Lawn, being called ‘_Nancy_’?”

“Nancy!” I echoed, opening my eyes. “Oh, yes—no—I mean—anything you like; but
why _Nancy_?”

Mr. Waters turned to me for a moment as the car sped smoothly down a level,
empty stretch of the white highway. “I’d better explain to you ‘why Nancy,’” he
said dryly. In those keen grey eyes of his, where some time before I had
suspected a gleam of humour, I now saw a quite unmistakable twinkle of fun!
There was even a twitch at the corner of those tightly-fitted lips. But he went
on still more dryly. “When I informed my mother that I was engaged to be married
to a lady in the office, she had a good many questions to put.”

(Well, I should think so! The Longer Catechism, in fact!) “Really?” I said
meekly. “And almost the first thing she asked me was what her Christian name
was.”

(M’m, “almost”—I wonder what the _very first_ thing was? What is it generally?)
“Of course, I ought to have foreseen that——”

(And _hadn’t_ he? Good gracious! The mapped-out scheme with _another_ flaw in
it!) —“but curiously enough, I’d overlooked it, and wasn’t prepared for it. Now,
I couldn’t very well tell my mother the truth, namely, that I did not know. I
have never been able to make out whether your usual initials were ‘M’ or ‘N.T.’
I had taken it for ‘N.’ So, on the spur of the moment, I gave her the first
girl’s name that began with N that I could think of.”

N or M! Yes! _Exactly_ like the catechism! For the first time in my life in
Still Waters’ presence I laughed aloud. Surely the country air and the rush
through it in the car must have gone to my head. Amazed at myself, but even then
laughing a little still, I pulled myself together to inquire, “And what did you
say to Mrs. Waters when she received my note signed by my real name?”

“Oh!—I said—something or other about ‘Nancy’ being the usual abbreviation for
‘Monica’ in some places!”

“How _quick_ of you!” I retorted—while my Near Oriental self sat back and gasped
at my new boldness. He _must_ have wondered at it too; thought it bravado, the
recklessness of despair, I suppose. “_Something_ had to be said! And I am
afraid, Miss Trant, that, for the matter in hand, ‘_Nancy_’ it will have to be.
A sort of _nom-de-guerre_, you know—if you can call it ‘_guerre_.’”

He was actually laughing himself now. This made his face look at least ten years
younger, changing him so that I felt him to be even more of a stranger to me
than the machine-like autocrat who rapped out his “_Now, Miss Trant!_” and his
“_Take this down_” at the Near Oriental. But in a moment he was serious again.
He seemed, for the first time, to feel something of what _I’ve_ been feeling
ever since we’ve been—so to speak, “engaged.”

“It’s asking a good deal, but I have to trust to you to meet all these
awkwardnesses as well as you can,” he said gravely. “And I’ll do all in my power
to avoid them, I assure you. A good deal of the strangeness can be put down to
the—er—natural shyness of people who are—so—er—recently engaged.”

“Oh, of course,” I murmured, struggling not to laugh any more. But I wondered
what other wild fictions about “_Nancy_” he’d had to improvise for his mother.
Supposing she’d wanted to know what I was like to _look_ at? Well, _he_ wouldn’t
know! Dark or fair—short or tall? As likely as not he’d tell her—as _something_
had to be said—that I was six foot high and a radiant blonde. And what would she
think of his not possessing a single photograph of me to show her? Really, he
was almost benighted enough, since he’d given me another girl’s name, to pass
off as mine another girl’s portrait! Even as I was laughing to myself again, the
car turned in at a stone-pillared entrance, and its plumply-tyred wheels purred
on a perfectly-gravelled drive between tall laurel-hedges. Oh! we were nearly
there, then. I didn’t want to laugh any more. Now for it....

CHAPTER XI

MEETING “HIS” PEOPLE

We skirted what seemed like an ocean of green velvet turf. We swept round
another corner. “There’s the house,” announced Mr. Waters. “_That_——?”

It was long and low and white and homely—yes! _homely_-looking—overgrown with
purple wistaria, and swept at one end by a fountain of gold from an immense
laburnum-tree. A deep, shady verandah was flung like a protecting arm about the
waist of the house. The late sunlight flashed on a scurry of something all
goldeny-white, as there rushed out of the shade of this verandah what looked
like a mix-up of several dogs and flying skirts....

“_Girls?_” I thought, as two slender, white-clad figures came towards me. “Who
are _these_?”

“My sisters, Theodora and Blanche,” said the Governor quickly to me. “_Down_,
Cariad! Down, sir,” to the little dog—there was only one of him, it appeared,
when he stopped frisking for a moment about the man who was helping me to
alight. The taller of the two girls came forward first, murmured timidly, “So
glad you’ve come!” held out both hands with an awkward, diffident little smile
that was quite charming, and bent very shyly to kiss me. She was about eighteen,
with fair hair, and features very cleanly-cut and something like her brother’s.
“_I_ am Blanche,” she murmured. “This is Theo.”

“Theo,” seemed to be about fifteen. My first impression of her showed me a pair
of long coltish legs and a round cowslip-bell of a head, covered with short
yellow curls. She said nothing, but she _looked_, looked at me out of a pair of
the largest and brightest brown eyes that I had ever met; they seemed almost the
size of the goggles in a diver’s helmet, and I felt them following me
devouringly as I was led into the hall. “Here is Nancy, Mother,” called Mr.
Waters. Another figure came forward to meet me. This—his mother? A startling
contrast indeed to what I’d pictured her. She was dressed in the soft, lacy,
unshaped black that best suits an elderly lady; and her soft, puffed-out hair
was grey all over. But that was as far as the “elderliness” of the Governor’s
mother went. Her figure was as tall and seemed nearly as slender as Blanche’s;
she had the long-armed, free movements that I’ve heard my father praise in Miss
Ellen Terry; her face was pink and irregular-featured and mobile, her expression
shy and smiling. She seemed like some girl who had fallen into a trance in the
“Eighties,” from which she had just woken up to find that her hair was no longer
brown, and that the world, which puzzled her a little, had gone on without her.
Her voice was soft and hesitating, and full of unexpected half-tones. “Oh, have
you come? Nancy! You are so welcome, my dear! I called you ‘Miss Trant’ in my
note, because I thought it was the right thing when I hadn’t ever seen you. But
I needn’t go on being so stiff, need I? Billy said he thought I needn’t.”

The Governor had disappeared towards the car again. “Your boxes have gone
upstairs, dear, and you might like to rest before it’s time to get ready for
dinner. _Blanche_ will take you to your room,” added Mrs. Waters, holding back
Theo, whose yellow head and whose long legs seemed just about to precipitate
themselves after me—for that child to enjoy another good look, no doubt. “_No_,
Cariad, you can’t go either! _Come_, Missis’s little dog”—the long white body
was frolicking about just ahead of me. “He _knows_ he never enters the house!”

And I knew the pet dogs who are supposed to cherish these rules. Cariad flung
himself gleefully in front of the diffident, fair-haired Blanche as she escorted
me upstairs. We were on the landing when the sound of a voice that I hadn’t
heard before, clear as a bell and distinct as a choir-boy’s solo, rang up to us
from below. “No _won_-der, Mother! Mother, I say, no _won_-der! _Is_-n’t she
pretty? Billy never _told_ us! He never——.”

Here an abrupt full-stop. “Oh, I do hope you won’t mind Theo; she _is_ rather
awful sometimes,” murmured Blanche Waters, as apologetically scarlet as if she
had done something to offend me. “She will say things—and so _loud_! It’s _only_
because she’s so pleased—and she’s only thirteen really—it’s awful being so
tall. People always expect you to be so much more sensible, somehow! This is
your room.” She opened a white door. “Outside, Cariad! (He _knows_ he never
comes upstairs.) Do let me unpack for you, Nancy.”

“Oh! Thank you so much, but——”

I felt I must, _must_ be left to myself for the present. At the risk of seeming
ungracious, I added hastily, “I can manage, really!”

Even though I’m _not_ fated to be a sister-in-law, I should like this nice girl
to like me. So I smiled up at her, and she put out a long, rather bony young
finger, and just touched my coat-collar. I realized that I needn’t have “fussed”
so over my “trousseau.”

“Ah! I daresay you’re tired, too.”

“I am, rather.” (Strictly speaking, I am ready to drop, though not entirely with
fatigue.) “Then I’ll send up some hot water presently, Nancy. (_Come_, Cariad!
)”

And she left me to what I felt I must have or perish—the solitude of my own
room, leisure to gasp over the series of additional shocks I had just received.
*       *       *       *       *

First and foremost, though it seems a funny detail to push itself in front of
all the other things, there’s “_Billy!_”

To think that Still Waters should be “Billy” to anyone—even if it’s only to his
mother! After Miss Holt’s “Do you ever call him _Billy_, by any chance?” and my
solemn “Never!” to realize that the man who Miss Robinson vowed “could never
have been anything so human as a little boy” does actually possess that
characteristically little-boyish pet-name! And I suppose I shall be expected to
call him that while I’m here? My goodness! “William” I was prepared for.
“William,” with its touch of stiffness—and—stateliness, I might manage.
But——Still, if I must, I must. In for a penny, in for a pound. (Only in this
case it’s meant being in for five hundred pounds!) And then that he should have
that unexpected, that utterly uncharacteristic, that un-Waters-like sort of
mother! Welcoming me like that! All I can say is that he—the Governor—_must_
take after his father exactly! And the house! Not in the least like a
sarcophagus—or even the corner of the British Museum with Near Oriental
fittings, as _I’d_ pictured it! Looking round this bedroom they’ve put me into,
I see it’s exactly the sort that I’ve always loved, particularly since my lot
has been cast in that poky little egg-box of a Battersea flat, with one skimpy
strip of bedroom window giving on a view of grimy-grey back-yard, a kennel made
out of a packing-case, and lines of washing hanging out to dry. Here, at The
Lawn, my quarters do seem so palatially big and airy! There’s _miles_ of
wardrobe space for my new things, I see. And _what_ a lovely long mirror! That
delicious scent of lavender and pot-pourri comes from the big china bowl on the
window-ledge. There’s a wide bay of casement-windows looking out on to that
wonderful lawn, sprays of feathery mauve wistaria tap against the panes outside.
Inside, rose-peonies and giant tulips riot over the cream-and-red-and-pink-
patterned chintzes of hangings and upholstery. The wallpaper is sprinkled with
bouquets of rosebuds caught up with ribbons; and the bed-spread is of glowing
rose-colour. No trace anywhere of those “Art-muds” and sad sage-greens that even
well-off people get into their rooms so often now. Why can’t they realize that
greens, to be successful, must be kept out of doors? Green as an indoor
background, _no!_ I’d have chosen just these gay, dainty patterns and colours
for my bedroom, if——

But _what’s_ the use of thinking over the house I might have had? I’m not going
to. I ought to be breathlessly thankful that this one where I have to spend a
fortnight is turning out to be so much more congenial than I’d hoped, and that
“his” people are quite unlike “him!”

How suddenly “right” my dear old silver-and-crystal toilette things look against
the setting of the Sheraton dressing-table with the plate-glass top! To think
that one dismal wet day I nearly packed them all up and sent them off by Mrs.
Skinner to be “put away,” and the price thereof turned into new boots! “Boots a
poor typist must have,” I argued. “Silver-topped bottles and luxuries of that
sort she doesn’t need any more.” How frightfully glad I am, now, that I hadn’t
the heart to do it after all, that I sent my shoes to be re-soled instead—and
that all my own monogrammed brushes are mirrored in the oval glass beside that
lustre jar of rich, mahogany-coloured wall-flowers that, next to my own dark
head and its moving reflections, seem to give the deepest touch of colour in the
room. I suppose the girls put those there—Yes! That’s another shock. The
_sisters_! That _he_ should have sisters like——

A tap at the door. “Come in!”

Enter, explosively, the excited little white dog, followed by a large and shiny
copper can, and the eyes—they seem to dominate everything else about that
child!—of Theodora. “Brought you some hot water”—in a meek and muffled voice.
“Dinner is—(Put those _down_, Cariad! He _knows_ people’s slippers aren’t for
him to eat!) Dinner is at eight. _I’m_ not supposed to come down.”

Here the huge brown eyes turned ruefully for a moment from me to the gleaming
sheath of the new frock that I’d just thrown over the brass rail of the bed. I
guessed the thought behind them. They longed for another satisfying stare at
it—_on_ me. Why shouldn’t I have this child fond of me? “Shall I say good-night
now, then, Theo?” I suggested. “Or—if you tell me which your room is, shall I
come in after I’m dressed?”

“Oh!” exclaimed Theo, bell-mouthed. “_Gem!_” Then, carefully muffling the voice
again, “That’s the school-room door opposite—between the corridor window and the
picture of ‘Delia in Arcady.’ Thanks _awf’ly_, Nancy. (_Come_ along, Cariad! )”

Not every engaged girl has such a walk-over with “his” people! But I think Theo
would approve of me as a sister-in-law, if she were going to have the chance! I
shouldn’t mind _her_!... On second thoughts, I don’t know whether I am so
pleased after all that these people are so kind and welcoming and different from
what I had expected. Wouldn’t it be almost easier for me in some ways if his
mother and his sisters _were_ the “collection of frosty-faces” (as Miss Robinson
expresses it) whom I’d anticipated meeting? I was prepared; I could have coped
with _them_. Why has he got sisters like these—just the kind of girls I could
imagine sisters of _mine_? Why _must_ his mother be so sweet to me, without a
gleam of the “designing-little-minx-of-a-typist” look in her eyes, without—I
verily believe—a thought of it in her heart? Ready to take to her arms the
stranger within her gates whom she looks upon as her son’s lady-love—oh, it’s
too embarrassing! For the first time since this sham engagement was arranged
between my employer and myself, I feel what I did not feel when I confronted my
fellow-typists, the Vandeleurs or Cicely with the news that I was Mr. Waters’
_fiancée_; what I did not feel when I first slipped these lying diamonds on to
my finger; what I didn’t feel when I cabled that money to Jack, or even when I
wrote to Sydney. I feel—there is no other word to express it—downright _mean_!
How am I going to stand a whole fortnight of it? How _am_ I to keep up this
incessant pose and pretence under the gentle, unsuspecting eyes of Mrs. Waters?
I believe I could have calmly invented fib after fib for the benefit of Lady
Vandeleur——

Now, now! Thoughts beginning with “Vandeleur” have got to be sternly suppressed
unless I mean to give myself a fit of the blues and make some terrible _faux
pas_ presently, at dinner, in the bosom of the Governor’s family. So come,
Monica Trant, my child—“Nancy,” I mean, of course, _Nancy_! (How I hope I shall
remember to answer to that name when I hear it, instead of forgetting who they
mean and imagining it’s the little white dog!) You pull yourself together,
Nancy, and dive into the pretty new evening-frock—it will be gorgeous to have
proper lights and a real glass to dress by once again!—then go and show it off
to that avid-eyed child in the school-room. And then downstairs with you, to
earn some more of your five hundred pounds! CHAPTER XII

THE FIRST DINNER

Well! the first evening is over. It hasn’t been nearly as bad as it might,
though it certainly has produced several more quite unexpected developments. We
dined; for the first time for well over a year I sat down at a luxuriously-
appointed round dinner-table with all its conventional daintiness of perfect
napery, silver and glass—instead of the picnic-supper affair, with every single
plate and fork an “oddment,” cast by the hands of Mrs. Skinner upon the rickety
table at Marconi Mansions. Instead of gossiping with Cicely Harradine clad in
the faded green Japanese kimono that she finds “such a rest to slop into” after
all the fashionable dressing-up at Chérisette’s—for Cicely is rather the type of
girl whom work demoralizes instead of bracing—I was of a party of two other
women and a man in evening-dress. That dinner-jacket does make the Governor look
so much younger—it’s positively laughable! For another thing, it seems to take
him right out of his isolated Near Oriental niche, and to put him in the same
rank of human beings as men who used to dine at our house when my father was
alive. Positively, I have begun to look upon my once-dreaded employer as quite
an ordinary—though certainly _not_ a likable—sort of young man! Never again need
_he_ expect to keep up, with me, the attitude of a metallic species of Business-
deity who disappears after business-hours to some vague, chilly and unknown
Olympus, of which no glimpse would ever be vouchsafed to any of us, his
grovelling subordinates. Oh, no! Not now that I’ve seen his people, the pretty
things out of which his mother has made such a nest of a home for him; not after
making the acquaintance of Blanche and of that gift of God, Theodora, and of
Cariad. That little outdoor dog spent the whole of dinner-time cosily curled up
under the table on his “Missis’s” black satin skirt, and not all the flappings
of the Governor’s table-napkin or his curtest “Here! Out of that, Cariad!
Outside, sir!” had the slightest effect in dislodging him. I would have given at
least five of my as yet unearned five hundred pounds for Miss Robinson to have
been granted the sight of Still Waters cheerfully defied by that small Sealyham!
I can see her “potting” the scene, with Miss Holt’s white feather neck-ruffle
commandeered to represent the little dog who “_knows_ that skirts aren’t there
for him to sit upon!” And _I’m_ not “there to be sat upon” any more, either! I’m
beginning to wonder how the Governor managed to “take me in” for so long! Why,
he is a regular _fraud_! And a fraud found out is never terrifying—even if it’s
exasperating. If anyone is going to be alarmed now, it’s not his official
_fiancée_, but he himself; for he was—yes, positively!—nervous and embarrassed
at dinner. If that had been the first time I’d met him I should have thought
that the big and blonde and silent young man opposite was _deadly shy of me_! Of
_me_; after all that he had handed out to me in the way of orders and commands
and arrangements during the past fortnight. It is a good thing if, as he says, a
good deal of the “strangeness” will be put down to the “natural awkwardness of
people so recently engaged”—but it’s a still better thing that I contrived to be
rather less “awkward” and speechless than _he_ was! To myself I seemed to be
sitting a little apart, watching another Mon—Nancy, I mean—smiling and chatting
gaily with his mother and the younger girls. What dears they are! and how one
sees their feminine touch in everything about the room, from the arrangement of
the many and becoming lights, to the graceful massing of sulphur-coloured
pansies and gypsophila in the centre of the round table! At dinner it was
chiefly, I think, of flowers that we talked—such a nice, safe subject. It seems
that the Governor is actually interested in gardening. _How_ amazed the staff
would be if it were hinted that Still Waters took the vaguest gleam of interest
in anything outside making money for the firm! After dinner, when he remained
behind in the dining-room to smoke, his mother slipped one white hand into
Blanche’s arm, the other into mine; and the gesture, I know, was meant to imply
that she had “another daughter now.”

We stepped together across the black-and-white-tiled hall into the drawing-room,
with its ordered chaos of pretty, old-fashioned furniture and dainty new things,
and the unmistakable atmosphere of a homey room that is lived in. Mrs. Waters
drew me down beside her on the wide, shallow sofa, and I saw her eyes dwelling
on every line of my face, as if she were trying to learn fresh knowledge of her
son from the girl who presumably was permitted to see him as his own mother
never sees a man. That brought a lump into my throat. I bent my head over my
work—a bit of Richelieu embroidery with which I had taken care to provide
myself. I had remembered some axioms of Miss Robinson at the office:

“_Never you be without a hit of fancy-work, girls, when you wish to impress. Men
seem to think a girl must be so sweet and womanly who can sit for hours wagging
a crochet-hook and a bit of thread at them. As for the future mother-in-law, she
always imagines a girl is more likely to turn out domesticated if she cannot
keep her hands still for ten minutes. Besides, a bit of drawn-thread work, or
whatever it is, gives you something to look at when you don’t exactly know what
to say next._”

The last reason was mine. I certainly did not know what to say when the
Governor’s mother remarked softly:

“You know, Nancy, you are just what I hoped you would be.”

“Am I?”

I felt an unutterable little _cad_. Yes, Mr. William Waters! And who forced me
into the position of feeling like this? “So pretty and gentle and quiet, and yet
you ‘see’ things with those brown eyes of yours,” pronounced Mrs. Waters. “At
first I feared it was impossible that any girl who had only met my boy just in
business-hours, and wearing that office-mask he has to put on, could grow to
care for him as we do; but I see you could understand. You guessed that all that
brusqueness and peremptory manner were just the armour for his sensitiveness;
you would see that he has to put on that manner to hide the awful truth that at
the bottom of his heart he is naturally as shy and nervous as Blanche and I are.
_I_ believe,” she laughed softly, “that that’s why he _never_ allows us to call
at the office while we’re in town! The staff _might_ suspect, seeing _us_, that
he _has_ another sort of manner than the terrible one he speaks through the
telephone with! I dare say that even you were taken in by it at first, weren’t
you? Until he began to reveal his real self to you, I expect you looked upon him
merely as a business-machine, didn’t you, Nancy?”

“I suppose I did,” I murmured, feeling more uncomfortable at every word uttered
by this dear, innocent lady, who had created such an idealized version of her
son’s character. “And when did you begin to find out the real Billy?”

_Here_ was a nice question! Thank goodness I was spared the answering of it! At
that moment the drawing-room door opened to admit the tallest of the admirable
parlour-maids, with the tray bearing a silver coffee-machine and the dainty
Dresden service. Blanche rose from the cushion where she had been sitting at my
feet, and went to the table to officiate. In her simple white dinner-gown she
looked like a tall lily bending down. “Mother, plenty of hot milk and a little
sugar? Nancy, how do you like your coffee?”

“I don’t take it, thank you very much.”

“Oh, then here’s Billy’s—black, with plenty of sugar. Will he be coming in for
it?”

Her mother gave a little smile. “I think perhaps Nancy won’t mind taking in
Billy’s coffee to him. Will you, dear? He’s in his ‘den’; the door just
opposite, across the hall.”

Even without her gently mischievous glance I should have realized what she
meant. The unsuspecting, sympathetic creature thought she was being kind and
tactful, making an opportunity for me to have a little time alone with my
_fiancé_. She imagined that we were longing for a lovers’ _tête-à-tête_, with
all the fond, foolish talk that one could guess at—beaming smiles at each other,
like Smithie’s—Ordinary love-making! Yes, of course, people will have to be
allowed to think that there’s that between us, too. I hadn’t wasted many
thoughts on this aspect of the case. But this “rubbed it in.”

I felt a wave of scorching scarlet rush up my face to the roots of my hair.
However, that didn’t matter: no doubt Mrs. Waters put it down to the “natural
shyness” of a girl in love. She never guessed the _furious_ mixture of feelings
that sent that blush into my cheeks. I kept my head up and my voice quite steady
as I replied: “Oh, certainly!”

And I rose, taking up the green-garlanded cup with the small gilt apostle-spoon
in the saucer, and left the drawing-room to face my first official _tête-à-tête_
with the Governor. Ever since he’s been the unconscious cause of my having had
to give up the chance of a serene and happy future with the man who really cares
for me, I’ve looked upon my employer with a mixture of resentment and dread. As
I say, the dread’s melted rapidly. But the resentment’s growing! “_I’ll_ make
him pay, somehow,” thought I revengefully, “for all this!” By “all this” I meant
not only for the loss of Sydney, and the castle at Ballycool, and comfort and
position, but for making me look and feel so acutely foolish before Mrs. Waters.
“I’ll see if I can’t make him rather uncomfortable over it himself,” I
determined. I crossed the hall, forcing myself to feel as if I were back in the
office, where we typists took it in turn to carry Mr. Dundonald’s cup of
afternoon tea into the inner sanctum, where he glowered over his figures. (How
cross he was if one of us shook the cup so that some of the tea slopped over and
soaked the lump of sugar and the biscuit laid in the saucer.) Gingerly I carried
the dainty cup of black coffee across to the door of the “den.”

There, deliberately, I tapped twice. The sound of my knock on the door reminded
me of another occasion—on which I’d presented myself alone before the Governor,
that afternoon at the Near Oriental; that first interview in his office. This
_tête-à-tête_—the first in his own home—was going to be very different! CHAPTER
XIII

THE FIRST TÊTE-À-TÊTE

A rather surprised voice called “Come in!”

In I went—to find the Governor smoking a cigarette and sitting on the wide red-
leather-padded club-fender of a room that was in complete contrast to the
feminine domain I had left. Almost empty, but for its tall bookshelves, a
grandfather’s clock, a couple of solid, “man-ny-looking” arm-chairs and a grand
piano. I dropped my voice into its meekest Near Oriental tone as I announced:

“Your coffee, Mr. Waters!”

It was exactly the tone in which I’d so often said, “Your tea, Mr. Dundonald!”
and yet I knew that the man before me would guess that this deference was, under
the circumstances, only a subtle form of defiance. I handed him the cup. Then I
stood there, outwardly as mild as milk, before him. One swift glance into the
mirror over the mantelpiece beyond his broad shoulder—his shoulders are the best
thing about him—had shown me an attractive picture enough—a big, blonde man
faced by a _petite_, graceful girl, with her night-black hair swathed in a silky
garland round her head, and her white shoulders and neck emerging from an
admirably-cut dinner-gown of creamy charmeuse and chiffon patterned by rose-pink
beadwork, whose colour echoed the soft flush in her cheeks. Just before dinner,
Theo, in the school-room, with all her eyes and half the voice-power at her
command, had told me the dress was _divine_, and that I looked a little _angel_
in it! “Angel?” H’m. That wasn’t how I _felt_, exactly. Still I know I looked my
best; as pretty as ever I’d looked in the dear old days before I had anything
else to do. Looking her best always keys a girl up to doing her best. (Or her
worst, as the case may be.) Besides, another glance at the Governor had shown me
that I’d been right in my suspicion at dinner. He _was_ embarrassed. He
was—probably for the first time in his life—_shy_! This put the finishing touch
to my feeling myself to be—also for the first time—mistress of this situation.
Therefore, I stood there, still waiting, looking as if it were I who were
paralysed with shyness, deliberately waiting for _him_ to speak. “Thank you,” he
had murmured as he took the cup from me. There was another pause, which was—as I
fully intended—the first of many. Then he added, in a rather uncertain sort of
voice, “I suppose it was my mother’s—my mother who sent you in here?”

“Yes! Oh, yes,” I said hastily, as if breathlessly flurried and meek beyond all
words. “She seemed to think—I didn’t know what else to do—am I in your way?”
(Here I glanced up at him with scared, appealing eyes as much as to say, “Is it
my fault if I am?”)

Pause. “I am afraid,” said the Governor, rather as if the words were forced from
him, “that I shall have to ask you to put with up this—er—incongruity for the
next half-hour or so. Won’t you sit down, Miss Trant?” And he wheeled forward
one of those capacious arm-chairs, placing it at a mercifully wide distance from
the fender-stool—where Mrs. Waters perhaps imagined we were at that moment
sitting—Oh shade of everything that’s wildly impossible!—sitting together like
ordinary young engaged people, hand in hand—or however they _do_ sit. My
goodness! I sat down, dropping my eyes demurely, and folding my hands in my lap.
Another pause. “I—er——” said the Governor, then stopped and tried to look as if
he hadn’t begun a sentence. “Yes? Is there anything that I can—that you think I
ought to be able to do for you while I am here, Mr. Waters?”

“Perhaps it might be wiser if you stopped calling me by that name”—dryly. He
seemed to have pulled himself together with a jerk, for he was looking and
speaking more like himself at this. However, it had no effect on _me_. “Oh, of
_course_,” I said obediently, “I shall _always_ remember to call you B——by your
Christian name (_that_ is an abbreviation, too, isn’t it?) when we are with the
others.”

“And then, if you use my other name when we are alone, you may forget, and let
it slip out when the others are here,” he objected, looking down on me from his
perch on the fender-stool, “and—and it’s more than likely that my sisters might
notice. Theodora notices everything.”

“Yes”—gently—“so I gather.”

“And always says out what she thinks,” her brother informed me. “That’s why—if
you don’t mind—I am going to continue calling you ‘Nancy’ even when we are
alone.”

“Oh, certainly,” I said softly. “And I suppose I must practise trying not to
feel afraid of you.”

He looked sharply at me, but I know there was no expression in my face, and my
eyes seemed fixed upon the hands in my lap, upon the ring I was turning, idly,
round my engagement-finger. “Afraid of me?” he took up. “You?”

“Oh, Mr. Waters—I _beg_ your pardon, I didn’t mean to use that name again. I was
going to say, you know that we are all terrified to death of you—at the office.”

I know he guessed that I meant “_but this is not the office, and I’ve lost all
the wholesome awe that I still had of you only yesterday, and I’m no more
terrified of you than Cariad is, now!_” Without looking directly at him, I saw
his keen, blonde face flush a little under its tan—this City-fied young man is
oddly sunburned—and his firmly-fitted lips moved as if he were going to say
something but thought better of it. After a pause he opened them again and
asked:

“Do you smoke—er—Nancy?”

“No, thanks very much,” I said primly. Silence fell. The Governor cleared his
throat. I knew he literally couldn’t think what to say next, and I exulted
inwardly. I felt as if I really were getting a little of my own back now—not
only for the awkwardness and unpleasantness due to the “engagement,” but for
everything I’ve loathed while I’ve been at the Near Oriental—the dreary journey
there morning after morning, the monotony, the irksomeness, the daily looming
terror of “the sack,” the hated hoverings round me of Mr. Dundonald and his
“_talk_-ing!”

_Oh_, how my employer was longing for me to “talk” at _that_ moment! to say
something—anything! But I wouldn’t. I think I could have let that lagging
silence last for quite another five minutes as far as I was concerned, only I
was afraid I might break into wild laughter unless I spoke. So I gave it up, and
suggested gravely and helpfully:

“I _have_ got some fancy-work with me, but I left it in the drawing-room. Shall
I go back and fetch it? Or—wouldn’t that quite _do_?”

“Afraid not,” said the Governor grimly. “It seems so stupid to sit here doing
nothing; for you, too,” I added sympathetically. “If you have brought any
letters down here from the office, you might, perhaps, care to dictate them to
me——”

“Thank you, no,” said Mr. Waters firmly. “I seldom do any business out of
business-hours.”

I turned my ring again ostentatiously. I hope he knew I was pointing out to him
how _my_ “business” had to go on all day long—the woman’s work, in fact, being
never done! My next mild suggestion was, “Do you play picquet?”

“Don’t know one card from another.”

I sighed, as if with mingled regret and boredom. It was a very insincere sigh!
for, to begin with, I loathe any form of card-playing myself; _I_ don’t believe
the story that cards were invented to please a mad king. I believe he was
_driven_ mad by the card-games of the period! Secondly, I wasn’t one bit bored.
I was revelling in the spectacle of this wretched young man—imagine being able
to employ such a phrase to the Grand Panjandrum himself!—this _wretched_ young
man looking so acutely uncomfortable and at such a loss. Gleefully I allowed yet
another long and awkward pause to take place. Then, I put my hand—the left
one—up to my mouth as if to stifle a yawn. Then I glanced at the ship in full
sail that rocked to and fro on the face of the grandfather’s clock, and murmured
resignedly: “Only twenty minutes past nine?”

“I am afraid that clock is always kept ten minutes fast,” said my host. I sighed
again, more deeply. Then I allowed my eyes to wander, as if vainly seeking the
way of escape!—round the comfortable, masculine-looking room. Actually, my
glance was caught by an odd-looking arrangement of wires across the ceiling.
“Oh, what are those for?” I asked. “Telegraphy?”

“No; I had those put there to improve the acoustics of this room. It was
otherwise so bad to play and sing in.”

“Oh!” I said, and wondering why Blanche didn’t use the drawing-room to sing in,
I glanced at the somber shape of the piano at the other end of the den. “I
wonder if you would allow me to practise in here sometimes—of course, only in
the mornings?” I requested meekly. “When I go back to London, I shall want to
see about a situation as music-teacher or something of that kind. I must have
some definite work to do—besides yours, I mean!—and I ought to furbish up my
playing.”

“Ah, you play, do you?” said Mr. Waters, in a tone of the deepest relief.
“Good!”

He got up, switched on some more lights, and opened the piano. “I wonder if you
have a rarer accomplishment still. Can you accompany?”

“I should be able to,” said I, with a little bitter smile to myself. For I’ve
certainly spent hours enough at the piano with Sydney Vandeleur, practising or
transposing his lyrics. He has a gift for pretty, tender melody-writing; he
“sets” all his favourite verses....

“Will you try over a song with me, then?”

(What! It was _he_ who sang?) “Certainly!”

This was not my subdued, Leadenhall Street office “Certainly.” It was the way in
which I might have spoken to Sydney, or to Major Montresor, or the Somervilles,
or any of the men who came to my father’s house in the old days, and for whom I
played in the evening. “Wait a minute. This gets in the way; clicks on the
keys,” said I, glancing at those weighty diamonds that blazed on my finger. And
I drew off his ring, pushing it with a careless little flick out of my way on
the glassy black top of the piano. He had put up before me Schubert’s “_Still
wie die Nacht_.”

Appropriate enough, for Still Waters! “Still as the night, deep as the sea——”

I took up the first chords. Then came surprise again. I had expected him to
possess a big, bull-dog bass, full of sound and fury, and without a touch of
feeling in it. To my amazement, his voice turned out to be a particularly sweet,
true tenor. Shut your eyes, and you could imagine that it was the most
sympathetic and delightful of men who was singing, instead of _the Governor_!
Can there be many more surprises about this man? However, I flatter myself that
I’ve given him several. The crushed-looking, deferential typist in the ready-
made delaine blouse, and with the carbon-stained fingers, that shook with
nervousness when he rattled off his far-too-quick dictation to them, was a
distinct contrast to this dainty, well-dressed young woman, who lays her own
plans for him to see that she is laughing at him in her sleeve. And it’s his
turn to use deference to me. “Thank you, so much—er—Nancy.” This last word
brought out with a jerk of resolution. “It’s a treat to be accompanied by
someone who can do it so unusually well; it’s like waltzing with a partner whose
step just suits one’s own.”

Good gracious! Where and when has this man learned to dance? But he _can_ sing.
I quite enjoyed playing for it. I think we went through quite half a dozen
songs—“Widdicombe Fair” was one of them—before I remembered that this wasn’t the
form I meant _my_ enjoyment to take. So, when he put up yet another—“Drake’s
Drum” this time—and said, “Shall we try this?” I relapsed into my wickedly mild
manner once more, and replied hesitatingly: “Don’t you think that would be
enough—for Mrs. Waters? I mean, that she would consider I had stayed the right
length of time? May—mayn’t I get down, now?”

“Oh! Sorry if I have tired you,” said the Governor quietly. He walked across the
room to open the door for me. There, with his hand on the door-knob, my employer
paused and looked down at me almost as if he were looking at me for the first
time. It was a curious sort of stare, half-amused, half-frowning. I should think
it must have lasted while one could count five. Was there a sort of _threat_ in
it? Yes! I suppose it meant that he wasn’t going to stand any more of my
masquerading impertinences, that somehow he meant to overawe me, to keep the
upper hand over me still. But he won’t. Of course it’s rather flurrying to be
looked at like that, so hard and unexpectedly.... But I wasn’t _really_
flurried——only a little glad when he opened the door, said “Good night!” and
shut it after me. I was turning towards the haven of the drawing-room when,
half-way across the hall, I heard the door of the “den” open again, and the
Governor’s step behind me. “I think you forgot this, didn’t you?” he said,
holding out to me the ring I had left lying on the top of the piano. “Oh,
_thank_ you,” I said apologetically. He went back into the den. I slipped my
“engagement” ring on to my finger again. As a matter of fact I _hadn’t_
“forgotten” it. And he needn’t imagine that he is ever going to have _me_
“quelled” again. I intend taking it out of _him_ all the time I am here! CHAPTER
XIV

THE FIRST QUARREL

So far I have had things all my own way. During the three days that I have now
been staying at The Lawn, I have managed to “keep up” without difficulty two
utterly distinct and different _manners_. “Manner A.”—assumed for the benefit of
the Governor’s family—the rather shy but charming and devoted young _fiancée_.
“Manner B.”—well, to be frank, a perfect little _cat_! But to begin with the
first manner. I should be ashamed to act it as well as I do, if it weren’t that
I must keep the whip-hand over the Governor, and that this is the only way, for
his mother and sisters are really too sweet with me. Never, during all the palmy
days of the Trant family, have I had so many pretty and generous things said
about me as I’ve heard in these three days from my employer’s unsuspecting
mother. She told me yesterday, “When Billy was ten I’d begun to wonder whether,
somewhere, some other mother was watching a pink-lined cot that held something
which was to become very precious, later on, to my little son. And—twenty-one,
are you, dear?—it must have been so, then. How glad I am it was you! Ten years
is such a nice difference in age, too; I was twenty-one——”

And her soft grey eyes looked at me as if they saw, through me, into the past.
Her young daughter Blanche, on the other hand, gazes at me as wistfully as
though, through me, she could look into the future. I feel as if I were supposed
to be standing beside a wall which only I am tall enough (for once!) to see
over. “_Sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?_” That, of course, isn’t what she
says. “Nancy, I suppose you knew almost at once what you felt about Billy?”

“Oh, yes!” (Readily.) “You knew he was absolutely the one and only? How lovely!”
A pause. “I suppose the way to find out is to imagine him among seventeen other
young men, all frightfully good-looking and nice and good sorts, and the right
kind of voice, and all wanting to marry you at once, and all that? Then, if you
still feel you could choose _him_ out of all those——”

“But, Blanche, I should have _had_ to,” I explained, truthfully enough, as I
thought of the five hundred pounds. “Couldn’t help myself!”

“I see,” sighed Blanche. “_Mustn’t_ it be glorious for you both?”

And thirteen-year-old Theo, pouring upon her “new sister” the wealth of
superfluous adoration which will some day be wasted, I suppose, upon some quite
ordinary young man, proclaims at frequent intervals, “Isn’t it _ripping_ having
her here?” and lives entirely in the present. Theo, by the way, is the only one
of them before whom I feel I have to be careful not to over-do Manner A. Manner
B. is reserved for those hours which, for the sake of appearances, his official
_fiancée_ is obliged to spend alone with Mr. Waters; going for dull walks—that
is, for me they’re kept from being too deadly dull by the certainty that I am
making them so for him!—and sitting with him in the den, where I will _not_ play
accompaniments to his songs except as a last resource after I’ve exhausted every
possibility of the stilted remark, the awkward pause, the resigned glance, and
the languor that stops short only at the visible yawn. Since that first _tête-à-
tête_ I have brought the contrasting of Manners A. and B. to a fine art. I’ve
been revelling in the idea that for a whole fortnight this is what my employer
will be forced to put up with. After all, it’s what the whole lives of some
_married_ men amount to! And, according to the terms of the Governor’s own
agreement, there’s nothing in all this of which he can openly complain! *
*       *       *       *

He _has_ complained! Really, I need not have been surprised when it occurred,
though I was scarcely expecting it. It began this (Saturday) morning, at
breakfast. Now, any outsider peeping into the sunny dining-room might have
considered that the group round the breakfast-table made an ideal picture of
English family life. There was the gentle, grey-gowned mother pouring out
coffee. The big, blonde son of the house, dressed for the City, sitting opposite
to his _fiancée_—rather silent, but presumably only out of devotion. The
_fiancée_ herself, a small brunette in dull-pink linen, looking, I think I may
say, the picture of girlish sweetness, and being made much of by the two
younger, taller, fair-haired sisters. For no outsider could have suspected that
the small, dark girl and the big, blonde man were secretly at daggers drawn. Nor
have the family a notion that I’m anything less than “the ideal wife for Billy.”

I had come down last, to be greeted by the clarion voice of Theo, now no longer
muffled in my presence. “Nancy! _Here’s_ news for you! Juno what? Our celebrated
Uncle Albert Waters is coming down to inspect Billy’s sweetheart!”

“Oh!” I said smiling. I didn’t see then why I shouldn’t smile. I hadn’t yet
heard anything about this other Mr. Waters. “It’s to be hoped that he will
admire her as much as we all do,” proclaimed Theodora; “because, if he doesn’t,
won’t it be a ghastly week-end, Mother?”

“Nonsense, dear! Don’t try and alarm poor Nancy about the new relation she has
to meet.”

“But—fancy! Meeting Uncle Albert _for the first time_! Golly!”

“Theo-dora!”

“I know. I did promise to chuck saying ‘Golly,’ but really it’s the only word
that seems at all _like_ Uncle Albert,” declared the child. “Uncle Albert’s a
terror! Talk about me-ee! Yes, talk about _me_ saying everything that comes into
my head! Why, it’s from him that I inherit that! Only, I’m not in it with him!”

“It would be a good thing if you were, Theo,” reproachfully from Mrs. Waters. “I
am sure your uncle has a heart of gold.”

“Always means there’s something else the matter with a person”—thus the
irrepressible Theo. “People with ‘hearts of gold’ are either fearfully rude like
old Miss Crabbe, and never say ‘Thank you,’ or they don’t care a rap what they
do say, like Uncle Albert. If he doesn’t happen to approve of Billy’s _fiancée_,
he’ll think nothing of telling Billy to break off——”

“Break off yourself, young woman. You talk a good deal too much,” put in her
brother, as he rose, big and well-groomed, from the breakfast-table. “And keep
Cariad, will you? He knows he never follows anyone but his mistress, but I’ve
had to send the station-master’s boy back with him three times this week. Good-
bye, all.”

“Good-bye,” said I sweetly. “Give my love to the Near Oriental, especially to
the typists’ room, will you? How stuffy it will be getting there now! How
thankful I am for anything that keeps _me_ out of it on a morning like this!
Still, I suppose one ought not to abuse the place where we first met.”

This with a glance at him, expressly for Blanche’s benefit, from under my
eyelashes. For I am acquiring a taste for positively “baiting” my employer. I’m
not going to be the one made to feel all the awkwardness of the situation. Not
I! Let _him_ redden with embarrassment before the guileless remarks or questions
that I aim at him before his mother and sisters. Serve him right! As for my
employer’s feelings towards me, I have seen them ripening from obliviousness of
my presence, through indifference and dislike, into positive _hatred_! I knew
he’d felt the flick of my last remark. I also knew how he would have liked to
retaliate. Any time since that first evening in the den I have seen in his eye
the yearning to take me by the shoulders and shake me. But he said serenely: “It
is a glorious morning, certainly. Too fine not to walk down to Sevenoaks, so I’m
starting a little earlier.”

Good! I thought. I always welcomed the moment that saw the last, for the whole
happy, idle day, of the only inhabitant of The Lawn with whom I’m not on
excellent terms. Once _he’s_ out of the house, I can enjoy myself and forget
(almost) why I’m in it. So it was an annoying shock to me when he stopped short
on his way to the door and added:

“Nancy, do you care to come part of the way towards the station with me?”

He had me there. I saw there was no escape. For the first time this week he was
able to check me in having things all my own way; and, mortified and irritated
as I felt, I could only smile up at him in Manner A, and reply, all eager
delight:

“Oh, I’d love it! Give me two minutes to put on my hat.”

In five minutes—for I knew he’d loads of time for his train, and it was still a
further turning of the tables to keep the Governor waiting—I joined him outside
the front door. Presently we were walking briskly together down the drive
between the green cliffs of laurel; the air was sweet with the scent of sun-
warmed lilac, the sky was cloudless, the morning all sunshine—everything, in
fact, was as unlike my own mood as might be. For I’d guessed that I was “in for”
something. And although I didn’t yet know what this might be—although it seemed
a whole pre-existence since the day when the prospect of a few words from the
Head of the firm made his trembling typist feel that the end of all things was
at hand!—I still felt, amongst other emotions, a little _frightened_. Again I
saw in my mind that odd, half-amused, half-threatening stare which the Governor
had bent upon me that first evening when I said good-night at the door of his
den. Supposing I wasn’t able to keep the reins in my own hands after all? A new
nervousness mingled in me with an utterly new form of resentment. I hadn’t long
to wait for my few words from the Governor. He began—rather to my
surprise—without his traditional “Now, Miss Trant,” but grimly and stiffly as I
don’t suppose Mrs. Waters knows he can speak. “Now! There is something I wanted
to say to you. I am sorry to trouble you, but I am afraid that I have to ask you
to be a little more careful in your manner to me.”

Which of the two manners was he going to fix upon? The one I reserved for him
alone, or the pretty one that I used to him before his people? “My manner? Oh!”
I turned a dismayed face, the face of a typist caught out in some careless
mistake, up to his as we walked along. “I am afraid I don’t quite know what you
mean.”

“You do,” said his face. But he only said concisely: “I mean the tone you
sometimes feel called upon to adopt towards me, as just now, at breakfast. Of
course when we are alone you must please yourself entirely. But that will hardly
do before others.”

Ah, it was for Manner A, then, that he’d settled to take me to task. So none of
it had been lost upon him, then; none of the unearthly sweetness hiding home-
thrusts that only he was able to recognize as such! None of the elaborate ways
in which I’ve been pretending to think of little things to please him; quoting
(in public) bits of his songs that I call my favourites, picking a sulphur-
coloured pansy—that he daren’t _not_ wear!—for his button-hole, then making him
take it out to let me change it for a leaf of scented geranium, because there
were table decorations of those at the Savoy “the day we lunched there before
you chose my ring; do you remember?” I hope he’ll never cease to remember _and
to regret_ “that day!”

For the whole nature of the grudge I have against him has changed in these few
days. The thoughts have gone into the background of all that office drudgery and
Near Oriental unpleasantness. I’ve forgotten that I used to hate him as part of
a life of being ordered about on a few shillings a week. But when, in accepting
this invitation to a house of luxury and leisure, I had the feeling of “coming
home” to my old sort of life, I hadn’t realized how many of the feelings
belonging to that by-gone life were going to wake up again inside me,
indignantly ashamed. I was my father’s daughter. I was well accustomed to the
ease and space and comforts of such a house as The Lawn—the Waters don’t suspect
that, but I _was_ born to them. I wasn’t born, however, to taking up the
position in such a house which he has forced upon me. Dully simmering in my
mind, for some time now, has been the thought of this slight which he has put
upon me, this insult. This was the thought that softened my voice into the timid
and suppressed “office” key, which I felt I couldn’t keep up very much longer.
“Have I been saying and doing the wrong things before your people then? I am
sorry!”

I hoped my voice was not going to run away with me, but I heard myself beginning
to lose control over that serviceable meekness as I went on. “It is rather
difficult for me, you know. Still, I did think I _seemed_ everything that your
_fiancée_ ought to be! I have been trying——”

“You have,” admitted Mr. Waters grimly. “Very.”

“Do you mean I _haven’t_ been a success, then?” I heard myself demanding
quickly. “Oh! Because, if I don’t give satisfaction——”

I stopped. It wasn’t my place to finish the sentence with “I had better give
notice!”

“H’m,” said my employer curtly. “I see.”

Did he “see,” I wondered? Did he realize that, though I was bound hand and foot
by that absurd muddle of an agreement, he might break it when he chose, and that
I was longing, desperately, for him to do so then and there? “It’s very hard,” I
explained as evenly as I could, hoping that this explanation would give him his
cue, “hard to manage to hit the right note always, and to have to decide every
minute upon the way I should naturally behave if I really _were_ engaged; Of
course _I’m_ under contract, but——”

Here, very suddenly and unexpectedly, Still Waters broke out into a tone I’d
never heard from him before. He positively “let himself go” as he lashed out
with his walking-stick at an inoffensive dock-leaf in the hedge-row we were
passing, and exclaimed:

“By Jove! I’d pity any man who was ‘really engaged’ to _you_!”

Ah! So I had got him to speak his mind at last, his own mind that he would have
given anything not to have revealed to any employee! More than that, I’d driven
him into being inexcusably rude to a woman. His face, where the tan had deepened
to a sullen red, his lips, compressed into what seemed like a thin, pen-drawn
line, showed me that _he_ had realized this. _I_ don’t mean him to forget what
he said. I said nothing. The most awkward of all the many awkward pauses so far,
elapsed between us as we walked along, and before he spoke again. When he did, I
saw that it cost him more than he liked me to notice. “Yes. You see—I ought not
to have said that. I beg your pardon.”

“Oh! Please don’t! I didn’t mind it at all,” said I, better able to speak very
sweetly now that I felt I had regained some of my ascendancy. But all the fun of
“scoring” off him had gone, though I must not let him see that. “Of course
you’ve every right to say exactly what you think, just as Theo does.”

For his face, still flushed, ruffled, and without a trace of the “office-mask,”
wore a fleeting but quite laughable likeness to his youngest sister’s. I have
heard it said of some girl, “She isn’t pretty exactly, but she has pretty
looks,” and positively, if I didn’t dislike him so intensely, I should say that
the Governor, though never handsome, has “handsome looks” himself. I went on,
still mildly: “Only, you know, Theo and Blanche and your mother don’t happen to
think—what you’ve just said. They seem to consider that—well! that the man I was
engaged to isn’t—wouldn’t be at all to be _pitied_!”

“I know. You needn’t tell me that. You have contrived to make all three of them
ridic—extremely fond of you!” This resentfully, realizing it as part of my
insolence to him. “My mother and the girls don’t see through it, when you
are—are covertly reminding me, in a hundred small ways, of what I don’t need to
be reminded of. _That_ would be all right, therefore—only——Other people who came
to the house might not be so unsuspecting _They_ might chance to notice that
there was something odd—unusual—unnatural in your attitude to me.”

“But—but you said any strangeness would be put down to the awkwardness of a girl
so recently engaged?”

“No one would give _you_ much credit for being ‘awkward!’” Still more
resentfully. “And something might come out. That is why I am obliged to ask you
to be a little more guarded.”

“‘More guarded,’” I repeated meekly, like a child who is learning by heart.
“Yes. I must. I must try harder to make it seem less ‘unnatural’ that we two
should be engaged.”

Again the look, instantly banished, that meant he pined to shake me. “Thank
you,” he said. “And by the ‘other people,’ I suppose you mean this
other—outspoken Mr. Waters who is coming over to ‘inspect’ me? Do you think—are
you afraid that _he_ will be sorry for the man who is supposed to be engaged to
me?”

Under his breath Mr. William Waters muttered what _sounded_, at least, like the
one word, “IMP!”

I heard him. Perhaps it was only the first syllable of the word “Impertinence!”

At all events, I heard that distinctly. And though it meant I _had_ scored
another point and made His Imperturbability forget himself yet again, I couldn’t
enjoy the triumph of it, nor even laugh to myself. There had been too much of
all this.... I was suddenly tired. Tears, of fatigue, I suppose, rushed
unexpectedly into my eyes, and I was obliged to turn my head and glare over the
hedge at a may-tree in full bloom that became a dancing blur of pink. _He_ was
pretending that he hadn’t begun to speak at all. He began again, stiffly:

“My uncle and another man are coming over to-night. This uncle of mine is
eccentric in some ways, but extremely shrewd; and no—er—two-edged sort of remark
would be lost on him.”

“I see,” I said, blinking angrily at the next may-tree, but still controlling my
voice. “I had better not make _any_ sort of remark at all then, before him. I
could be too shy to open my lips. In fact, just as I am—used to be, at the
office. Would that be better?”

“Distinctly better than—er—recent methods,” said the Governor dryly. “This other
man is merely a business acquaintance with whom I hope to have dealings. So——”

“You want him to be favourably impressed,” I concluded intelligently, “with your
_fiancée_ and all your other belongings.”

“If you choose to put it so. But——”

A pause. “Above all,” said the Governor, “I don’t, on this particular occasion,
don’t want to be made to look a _fool_!”

It came out quite boyishly and slangily, and for a moment I could almost have
liked Still Waters for that. Then—yes! I thought, savagely, he mustn’t be
allowed to look a fool even for once, but I may go on looking a fool and worse,
for the next year! And then I saw that he was inwardly rating himself for
having, as he considered, played into the enemy’s hands—having allowed me to see
exactly when and where I could get the better of him next. He didn’t trust me.
“I will do my best,” I said, softly and bitterly. Let him suppose, if he chose,
that I meant doing my best to let him look a fool before his uncle and his
pompous fine business acquaintance, indeed. What would he amount to, I wondered,
this acquaintance of the Governor’s for whom I, Monica Trant, was to be on my
best behaviour? Probably someone Father wouldn’t have had in the house! We
reached the turning to the station and I stopped. “Was there anything else that
you wished to speak to me about?”

“No, thank you,” said my employer at his curtest. “That was all. Good-morning!”

He lifted his hat; his face beneath it was set with temper. Good! Let him vent
it on Mr. Dundonald at the office! “Good-morning,” I said, and turned away. I
was glad that there had been no one in the lane to see that parting; to anyone
who had watched, knowing who that tall, blonde, savage-looking man was who had
said good-morning so frigidly to that small girl with her head held in a very
straight line with her back, it would have looked so ludicrously like the last
thing in the world that it really was—a lover’s quarrel! How furiously he had
marched off! I turned round, after walking on a few yards, to catch another
glimpse of that stampede. Then I was sorry. For at that very moment he had
elected to turn round and see me! It just shows that people are quite right to
teach children _never_ to turn round on the road. I wish I hadn’t! CHAPTER XV

“THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS”

“Nancy! I say, Nancy! Here’s Billy and this new man of his turned up _hours_
before we expected them, and mother’s out calling somewhere, and Blanche is in
the middle of washing her hair, and just look at the awful rip I’ve made in my
frock; _I_ can’t come!” announced Theo in a voice subdued almost to a stage
whisper when I met her on the stairs this afternoon. “So _you_ be a saint and go
in and talk pretty to the visitor till tea, will you?”

“All right,” I laughed; and passed on to the drawing-room. It was cool and dim
in there after the sunshine of the garden, where I had been lazing over a book
and forgetting this morning’s stress, and for a moment my eyes could scarcely
make out the two figures that stood with their backs to the white-curtained
French windows. Then, beside the Governor’s tall bulk, I saw a small, dapper,
masculine silhouette with a rather too abrupt “pinch-in” at the waist of its
coat, and a perky, quick turn of the head; the general effect of Mr. Cyril Maude
in some military part that I had once seen. Was it this that seemed so familiar,
I wondered? A monocle fell with a click against a waistcoat-button; then, as I
came forward, a voice, also vaguely familiar, cried in amazement:

“Monica Trant! Little Monica! Well, _I_ am blessed!”

Who in the world was this that knew my name? I looked harder at him. Surely
it—Was it?—yes! it _was_ one of father’s old friends, Major Montresor. So _this_
was my employer’s “business acquaintance.” I felt myself trying not to stare.
The Governor, I know, was staring undisguisedly at the pair of us. “Why, bless
my soul, Monica! Who’d have expected to see _you_ coming in like this?”

“Or you, Major Montresor?” I retorted, obliged to smile at him as I held out my
hand to his always tenacious clasp. To be frank, I can’t say I was at all
pleased that the Governor’s visitor had turned out to be someone who’d seen me
so often in the old days. I don’t want those days to be mixed up with these.
Already a ghost or so out of those days had seemed inclined to come and haunt
the lovely garden and the big, comfortable rooms at The Lawn! And now I seemed
to see a regular Richard-the-Third-like procession of those ghosts rising up
behind the little Major’s trimly-waisted figure—people with whom I’d associated
last time he’d seen me—standing in judgment, echoing his “Who’d have expected to
see _you_?”—adding their phantom stares to those of the two men whose eyes were
actually upon me. It was tiresome; might mean all sorts of adaptations; even the
assumption of a “Manner C” for the benefit of Major Montresor! As for him, he’s
a rather amusing, tactless, talkative, would-be-man-of-the-world sort of person,
who’d been quite ready to get up what Kipling calls the “You’re-only-a-little-
girl type of flirtation” with me when I was seventeen or so. I hadn’t met him
since, nor had I wanted to; though I had been distinctly interested, five years
ago, to find that someone who possessed medals and a moustache cared to talk to
me while I was still in the school-room. He’d got to look ever so much older
since then, balder, stiffer of movement in his slim boots and his stays—I beg
his pardon, I expect he called it his belt—and, apparently, more flirtatious
than ever! Now, any _woman_ over thirty-five has to be fairly attractive before
she’s allowed to flirt on without fear of ridicule. But a _man_ at fifty, or
fifty-five, seems to claim the right to monopolize the prettiest and youngest
girl he meets. It doesn’t matter if he hasn’t a hair on his head or a tooth of
his own in it. As long as he’s single and wears trousers, he’s an eligible
bachelor—or so he thinks. A mercy he doesn’t hear the ideas of the favoured girl
on this subject! So, quite unsuspectingly, Major Montresor beamed upon me, and
declared at least three times that this was a most _delightful_ surprise, upon
his word!—seeming almost to forget his host, who stood a little aside, looking
utterly disconcerted, as far as I could see without turning my eyes, to discover
that this “business acquaintance” knew his official _fiancée_ better than her
employer ever could! Christian names, too! “Monica—Bless my soul, what’s this?”

“This” was an interruption that precipitated itself through the unlatched French
window; a small white dog that bore in his mouth a large bone, noisome-smelling
and of the earth, earthy, which he dumped upon the Major’s japanned boot.
“_Cariad!_” growled the Governor, more angrily than I’d ever heard him speak
except to me, “what do you _mean_? Here, sir.” He grabbed him by the collar,
kicking the bone violently over the shallow sill in front of him. “Sorry, I
shall have to get the little brute locked up.” And he dragged the cheerfully
resigned Cariad out and along the gravel to the back of the house. “Decent sort
of young fellow, Waters; very clever business-man; useful to know; quite a nice
chap, too,” commented the little Major, lowering his voice as he turned to me.
“But, my dear child”—he always used the word “child” to excuse his gesture while
he patted my shoulder, or smoothed my lace collar, or played with my silver
chain—“my child, how _did_ you come to be here?”

“I am staying with Mrs. Waters”—demurely. “Well, well! So you knew them! Your
poor father didn’t, did he? You were at school with the girls of the house,
perhaps?”

“No. I met Mr. Waters”—still more demurely—“in business.”

“Business? Upon my word! Glad you’ve got such a business-adviser. Glad you’re in
the position to need one, Monica. I heard rumours of your poor father having
left you not very well off. Odd how these untrue bits of gossip get about!”—with
an experienced eye upon the expensive new afternoon frock of my preferred pink,
with its creamy ruffle, black velvet bow, and small paste buckle. “You look the
picture of prosperity and health and good looks, if you’ll allow an old friend
to say so?”

Well, one simply _has_ to “allow” things to people who call themselves “old.”
But for that, how many “old friends” would have received the order of “Paws
off!” or “No patting, please,” or a more politely expressed equivalent from the
girls who can’t be rude to their father’s contemporaries? I was only just about
to draw my hand away from another long and tender squeeze of Major Montresor’s,
when his host came back to us. Through the French window, as the Governor pushed
it open, a ray of sunlight caught and blazed on the magnificent diamonds of the
ring which had been bought at Gemmer’s for me to wear. Instantly Major Montresor
pounced on that other hand. “Hal-lo! What’s this? It isn’t——?”

“Yes,” said I, sedately. “Little Monica engaged?”

“Yes.”

“Come, not really, what? No! You don’t say so, really?”

“I am afraid I must, Major Montresor.”

“By—Jove! And I never heard! Here’s a blow!” He sighed tempestuously. “Well!
Youth will be served! Fortunate youth!” he prattled on without a break. “I’m
sure he’s to be congratulated, the dog. Always hanging round you in the old
days, I remember. Yes! Cultured sort of young Johnny with a beard—what was his
name, now? Ah, I have it—Vandeleur, of course, young Sydney Vandeleur!”

Pleasant for me, wasn’t it? To have this voice from the Past blurting out—less
tactful even than Cicely!—the name of the lover I had lost. In a flash I saw my
employer’s slight movement—saw by the passing look on his face that his
“business-man’s memory,” which never forgets a name, had instantly associated
that of “Vandeleur” with those people at the Carlton to whom I’d first
introduced my “_fiancé_.” What must he imagine? Still, that wasn’t the point.
The point was that he should explain to this gossiping little Major, as quickly
as possible, how things really—I mean officially, stood! To my horror he didn’t
speak. There was an agonizing pause. I shot a glance at the Governor....
Heavens! He, of all people, seemed utterly at a loss—fidgeting like a schoolboy;
he who could “break the news” to his staff at the office without turning a hair,
was leaving it all, here, apparently to _me_! Well! Hurriedly I was beginning:

“But, Major Montresor——” when the drawing-room door opened to the entrance of
Mrs. Waters, in her soft grey satin wrap and black picture hat; Cariad,
liberated and tail-wagging, in her wake. Greetings were exchanged—what talk
followed I scarcely heard, until the gentle voice of the Governor’s mother
exclaimed:

“Oh! Then you had met my son’s _fiancée_?”

“_Fiancée?_” echoed Major Montresor. His monocle dropped again, so did his jaw.
I never saw a man so utterly, so comically taken aback. He wheeled abruptly, to
stare from me to the Governor, then back to his hostess again. “Your son’s? Am I
to understand that it is _he_ who is engaged to Miss Trant?”

Here at last the Governor did find his tongue. “I have that honour,” he said,
clearing his throat, taking a step forward, and looking down at the little Major
just as some tawny Great Dane might have looked at Cariad—but no! No big dog can
ever look as utterly silly—there’s no other word for it—as a man who doesn’t
know what to say next. And he who had, it appeared, particularly wished to avoid
being made to look a fool on this occasion—Well! He must admit that it was none
of _my_ doing that he stood there looking like that! “Well, well, well! I
suppose I shall have to grin and bear it and congratulate you, Waters,” rattled
off Major Montresor. “I certainly _do_ congratulate you!”

“Doesn’t feel _sorry_ for you,” I added mentally, hoping the unspoken comment
showed in the one glance I allowed myself to steal at my employer as I crossed
over to sit on the low chintz couch beside his mother, while the visitor talked
on. “Still, you might have prepared me for this, my dear fellow. You might have
given your heart-broken rival some warning. Let me down a bit gently, eh? about
how you were robbing me of the one girl I’d hoped might solace my declining
years. Met Miss Trant, Mrs. Waters? Bless my life, rather! Used to billet myself
for months at Colonel Trant’s house in the old days—ripping old place it was,
too; gorgeous beech avenue; lawn something like your own here, but sweeping away
down to the river—oh, ripping! What’s become of the place now, Miss Monica; let,
I suppose?”

“Sold,” I said, shortly. Without looking up from the patch of carpet on which
Missis’s little dog slumbered with his muzzle resting against my shoe, I could
feel the change that came into my employer’s grey glance—the half-disconcerted
“M’m. News to _me_, all this!” expression that just flicked across his face. His
mother’s hand made a little movement towards mine—and for some reason I felt
that she was a little sorry.... I was furious! Why on earth couldn’t this little
he-gossip—though why they should understand by the word “gossip” an old woman, I
never _shall_ know—why couldn’t he allow these people to go on thinking that the
typist her employer had chosen to honour had never been before inside any sort
of house but one of a row of seventy or eighty, all with the same sort of pot-
plants hiding what lay beyond the Nottingham lace curtained windows, with the
same neat front door, and the same metaphorical wolf crouched grimly in front of
it! Desperately I wished that something might suddenly deprive Major Montresor
of the power of speech, only I suppose nothing ever could do _that_! Evidently
he wasn’t going to spare me anything. I was to stand full in the limelight of
other days. “Hope the new tenants will keep it up as they should, then, that’s
all”—genially. “They took on the fishing with it, I suppose? ‘Everything went
together.’ What? I see. Hope they’ll take as much pride as your poor father did
in those magnificent hot-houses of his. Ah, I’ve never tasted peaches like
those, anywhere else! Remember how you used to race me down to get the finest
peach before breakfast, Monica? Yes, hang it all, I think I shall have to ask
your leave to go on calling her that, Waters. Loved her from childhood’s hour,
y’see. Her childhood’s, not mine, of course!”

“Oh,” murmured the Governor. Miss Robinson would have been kept in high spirits
for the next week by that “Oh.”

It didn’t amuse _me_ much as I sat there, carrying out to the letter my promise
to say nothing and look shy. I was feeling at least as embarrassed as I looked
by the time tea was brought in and the girls made their appearance; Blanche with
her fair hair unmanageably soft from its washing; Theo, as usual, all eyes for
the visitor. I hoped they might distract his attention from me—they’re quite
young enough!—but no! All the time he was sipping his tea and munching slice
after slice of cake, the little Major continued to pour out comment after
embarrassing comment upon my affairs, addressing himself chiefly now to the
Governor. _He_ sat looking still more hopelessly uncomfortable and bigger than
ever in contrast to the frail china tea-cup and the slice of wafer-like bread-
and-butter in his clutch. Why do people allow men in at drawing-room teas? Why
couldn’t those two have been having theirs in the billiard-room—the
garage—_anywhere_—where I could have been saved from Major Montresor’s
relentless flow of conversation? “And to think I should have known you all these
months without suspecting that your gain was to be my loss—no, no, I don’t mean
the business part of it, my boy. I mean this engagement of yours, ha, ha! And
then—funny thing! to be congratulating the wrong man.”

“Oh, _were_ you?” burst suddenly, irrepressibly, from Theo, unable to check the
following “Who?”

“Theo-_dora_, dear!”

“Ah, never mind, never mind!” took up the little Major, turning quickly to the
child and smiling from her to me. “I don’t tell tales out of school, young lady.
But brown eyes”—with another monocled glance at those wide search-lights under
the yellow curls—“brown eyes always stand for fickleness! There must have been a
dozen at least of us that you treated disgracefully, Monica, eh? One comfort is
I’m not the _only_ sufferer!”

He was not! My heart sank lower and lower at the thought that this garrulous
little blunderer was to stay for dinner. And the other expected guest, the
outspoken uncle, was to be here for the whole week-end! What would _he_ be like?
Not worse than Major Montresor—that was the single ray of comfort. Nothing
_could_ be worse! Still, the two together—what a prospect! Even as I was
shuddering over it, the sound of some confused commotion was borne in to us from
the hall; and then a loud, bluff, breezy voice positively shouted:

“Name? My good woman, you’re pretty new to this house, or you’d know my name.
Same as your master’s. No! Don’t announce me. I’ll announce myself.” (As if this
were necessary!) “Where are they all? Tea? Good! Young lady there too?
Excellent!”

The door, this time, burst open, and in _avalanched_ (it’s the only word) Uncle
Albert Waters. CHAPTER XVI

THE ORDEAL BY INSPECTION

In looks, Uncle Albert Waters was just like the John Bull of the cartoons, minus
the hat. In voice, he was Theo through a megaphone. In manner, a genial form of
hurricane. “Now then, now then! How’s everybody?” he blared. “Mary! Blanche!
Theo!” (An explosive kiss to each.) “Ha! Billy, my boy!” (A violent blow on the
shoulder.) “Major Montresor, glad to see you again—how are you? Still defying
the enemy? Splendid!” (A pump-handle shake of the hand.) “Now, Billy!” turning
again to my employer. “You needn’t introduce _me_ to your sweetheart. She knows
who I am, and what I’ve come for. What I want is to have a good look at _her_.
Young lady,” to me, “will you be kind enough to oblige an old man whose
eyesight’s not quite what it was, by turning full to the light?”

I did. What else could I do? I sat, facing the low flood of late afternoon
sunshine, and feeling without seeing that all the others turned a little away
from me, while Uncle Albert fixed his prominent, honest grey eyes upon my face
and stared at it without reserve for—well! it seemed several of the longest
minutes I’d ever known. Then judgment was pronounced. “Well done, Billy!” Here
there would have been another of those heavy blows upon the Governor’s broad
shoulder, but he had edged away. “You’ve chosen well, boy. A bonnie girl, and a
well-bred one, and one to do you credit. Now, Mary, I’m ready for that tea. And,
you, my dear”—meaning me—“pass me the bread and butter. What’s your name, now?”

“My full name is Monica,” I said for the benefit of Major Montresor who had
fixed the monocle with something like mild indignation upon the last comer.
“They call me Nancy, here.”

“Nancy. A pretty name for a pretty girl, appropriate, too. ‘_All my fancy dwells
upon Nancy_’—eh, William? You used to sing that song once upon a time, dare say
you haven’t forgotten it, now?”

And so on, and so forth. I really don’t know how much more of it there was
before the dreadful old man had finished his ample tea and was carried off to
his room by the Governor in much the same humour, I thought, as he had dragged
Cariad and his bone to the back of the house. A pity Uncle Albert Waters
couldn’t be locked up in the tool-house! I felt like murder when I reached my
pretty room at last. What a day it had been! It had seemed forty-eight hours
long at least. Beginning with that horrible walk to the station with the
Governor—Then there had been the unwelcome appearance of Major Montresor and his
clumsy blunderings, first about Sydney and secondly about the old times at
home—and now this terrible old Uncle turning up to inspect and blare out his
embarrassing verdict upon my looks and suitability; oh, it’s the last straw!
It’s the worst that’s happened yet! There _can_ be nothing to beat the
Governor’s Uncle at tea, even though the evening isn’t yet over. I feel as if it
were long past bed-time, and there’s only half an hour or so before dressing for
dinner! Even half an hour alone——

But I haven’t been allowed a minute of it alone. The girls fluttered into my
room almost as soon as I came up; brimful of sympathy, but not sympathetic
enough to keep themselves from laughter. “Poor dear Nancy! Wasn’t it awful?”

“Didn’t I tell you Uncle Albert was a terror? But you don’t think he really
_talks_ like me, Nancy, do you? Billy _will_ say he _does_!”

“Theo! He can _easily_ hear you from his room, and the window’s open. Oh, I do
hope that when I’m engaged my young man won’t have _quite_ such loud relations!”

“Better than having deceitful whispery voices and saying horrid things in them
about you behind your back,” retorted Theo. “And anyhow, Uncle Albert did _like_
her!”

“Yes,” said Blanche, deprecatingly, “but isn’t it nearly as terrible as if he
disapproved?”

“It’s _worse_,” I decided to myself as I dressed for dinner, in my white, to
please Theo, who apparently has some mysterious child’s reason for wanting me to
wear that particular frock to-night. “Even if one were madly in love, a relation
like that would be quite enough to make one wonder if it were worth it! Yes!
Even if one were _really_ engaged to be married to a man—the man Mr. Waters
would ‘pity,’ one would break it off rather than put up with such an uncle-in-
law. Well! Thank goodness I’m spared _that_ at all events! I hope Uncle Albert
won’t pay many of his visits of inspection during the next year. One or two
ought to be enough for him, and I’ve taken the plunge now,” thought I, “and got
it over. He can’t go on being much more awful at dinner!”

CHAPTER XVII

THEO SITS UP

Yes! It was all of a piece with the fiascoes of the day that my little watch
gained ten minutes, hurrying me through my dressing and down, before I’d any
need for such haste, into the drawing-room. Here, big and black-and-white
against the giant pink roses of the chintz couch, I found (as I needn’t have
hoped not to find, on this day of _contretemps_!) my employer alone. He sprang
to his feet, of course, and wheeled forward a chair for me (looking as if he
wished he could have pushed it and me through the French windows and out of the
house for ever!—Goodness knows I reciprocated that wish!) and I sat down. Then
ensued what I’m beginning to call to myself “one of our pauses.”

But I felt that this evening my nerves wouldn’t stand silence—that nothing could
float me over these quicksands of awkwardness but an unceasing ripple of small-
talk. If _he_ wouldn’t, I must say something; anything! The first thing that
came into my head! “H—how close it is! Do you think there will be thunder to-
night?”

There was suppressed thunder enough on his face as he answered politely: “It is
getting rather stifling. Perhaps you would like the window open?” and he rose
and walked across to it. Then, from under the chintz valance of the couch where
he’d been sitting, there emerged at small and cringing form with an enormous
white satin bow tied to his collar. “Poor Cariad!” I went on, patting the
unusually subdued little dog, “you _have_ got a smart new tie! Don’t you like
it?”

A one-sided conversation didn’t meet the case, so the “dumb animal” (as they
call it) gave me the cue for my next remark to the almost equally dumb human
being. “I’ve always wanted to know where he got his rather curious name,” I
said. “What _does_ it mean?”

“It’s Welsh,” explained my employer abruptly, still standing by the open window.
“It means ‘Sweetheart’”—if you must know, his tone concluded. “Oh.... Is he a
Welsh terrier?”

“We got him from Wales. From a little place in Anglesey where my people
sometimes go for the summer holidays,” my employer vouchsafed, with an effort.
“Porth Cariad the name of it is—‘Port Sweetheart.’”

“Fancy calling a _place_ that!” I took up, with the one idea of keeping this
conversation from coming to a dead stop. “But some people call _anything_ that!”
(I was wondering inwardly what this last remark could possibly mean even as I
went on.) “Is it by the sea?”

“Er—I think so.”

“Oh, yes; ports generally are, of course.... Is it—is it a _pretty_ place at
all?”

“Quite. It hasn’t been spoilt yet. Charming little bay. The usual sort of
thing.” (Pause.) “Yes—? _Do_ tell me about it!”

“Oh! I don’t know—There are about two cottages. No end of gorse—heather.”

“How lovely!” Then, scenting another pause, I hurried on—“Isn’t there anything
_else_ there?”

“Well—There’s a sort of woman.”

“A woman? Really? How interesting! What sort of a woman?”

“Oh, a _wooden_ one,” returned the Governor, who was too obviously thinking
about something else. A wooden woman! What _could_ he mean by it? But before I
could begin my next question the door opened; the Governor turned quickly, then,
seeing who came in, he exclaimed in accents of concentrated disgust:

“Theo! Isn’t it time you were in bed?”

“No! Because I’m not going! I’m going to sit up for dinner, just for this once!”
announced the child, triumphantly advancing upon us in a Prize-Day “effect” of
let-down white skirts and long, cream-silk-stockinged legs. “I asked Mother, and
that nice old man” (Poor Major Montresor!) “begged her to let me, and I may! So
there! Nancy, _don’t_ you like the way I’ve done my hair for it?”

She had tied a fillet of white satin—a bit of the same ribbon which was
disconcerting Cariad—about her short curls. “What’s that for? To keep your
brains from bursting through?” demanded her brother crossly. But Theodora only
tossed that yellow posy of a head of hers, retorting that Major Montresor
thought she was sixteen, and was going to sit next her, and that there would be
a _surprise_ at dinner! *       *       *       *       *

The surprise—or the series of surprises—didn’t dawn upon me in its full
hideousness all at once. In the dim-shaded dining-room, where the tall maids
flitted noiselessly to and from the hatch at one end, the round table about
which the seven of us sat down seemed, with its many candles in the curving arms
of Sheffield candlesticks, its gleaming white porcelain, and its winking,
patterned array of silver and cut glass, like some great oasis of softly-radiant
light. Upon it, as table-centre, there was set the silver-bordered pool of an
oval mirror, reflecting a large silver goblet, round which I could read part of
the inscription:

1896     FIFTY YARDS SWIM——     SECS. 6——     W. WAT——

that upheld a pyramid of creamy, perfumed blossom, softened with sprays of
feathery white. Budding spikes of the same blossom were massed about the
pedestals of four little winged Loves, offering baskets that held tiny bouquets
of the white sprays, mingled with chocolates wrapped up in silver-foil.
Gradually but surely I realized the effect of all this decoration; it was
indescribably, unmistakably, blatantly—_bridal_! And then I realized who was
responsible for it. That gift of Heaven, Theodora, was beaming upon her
handiwork. It must have been her innocent hands, too, that had tied up each
table-napkin with a white bow and a spray of buds; had cut silver-paper out of a
chocolate-box into the miniature horseshoes that lay strewn negligently but
broadcast all over the tablecloth; and had encircled the place where I sat with
a wreath of crystallized rose-leaves in the shape of a heart. With one frantic
sweep of my hand I brushed these last into the table-napkin on my lap. I must
pretend I’d noticed nothing, and then (though I knew that thunder-cloud was
deepening every moment on the Governor’s brow) perhaps the others really
_wouldn’t_ notice! Vain hope! It was dashed even before the two usually so
sedate maids, who seemed, this evening, to emanate some subtle atmosphere of
sympathy and giggle, had finished handing round the soup. “Dear me! Who arranged
the flowers like this?” murmured Mrs. Waters, with a mildly bewildered glance at
this white-and-silver display. “I thought Blanche was going to have just the
little crystal tubs with the pink Maman Cochets and some maidenhair fern?”

“Yes, Mumsie, I was. But Theo _would_ put white heather and syringa!”

“Because—Oh, can’t you see _why?_” broke in the cornet voice of the youngest of
the family, who sat between me and the Major. And before anyone could answer or
check her, this appalling child went on to give chapter and verse for each of
her enormities. “It’s because, you see, syringa’s so awfully like orange-
blossoms!—They call it ‘mock orange!’ And I meant it for Billy and Nancy!”

She paused for breath (so did everybody else), then she hurried on. “Yes! I did
the table, because I wanted it to be appropriate! So I took away those everyday
bon-bon dishes and fetched out these little china Cupids to hold the choc’lates
instead! _Aren’t_ they ducky?”

No one responded, but every eye was upon Theo, who took it all for approval and
beamed again, enlarging upon her arrangements. “And that’s why I got Nancy to
put on her white satin”—

(_Ah!_)

—“with those lace lilies round her front, so’s she could look more like a
_bride_!”

(What I did look like at that moment I don’t know. But the Governor couldn’t
have looked more like the executioner in a cloak-and-dagger film drama.) “And
_do_ you see the confetti, of those teeny silver horseshoes, and the pink rose-
leaves strewn over—Oh, Nancy!”—reproachfully—“_Look_ what’s happened to the
Heart! And that was supposed to be Billy’s!”

Here I saw the mouth of Uncle Albert, who was sitting facing me at Mrs. Waters’
right hand, open in readiness for that approving bellow of his. “Never mind,
I’ll make another. I _wanted_ to do it all like this the first evening she came
down,” explained Theo further. “Only, of course, we weren’t quite sure then
whether she’d like it—”

(_Like_ it!) —“but it _was_ all my idea!”

_Then_ came the bellow of laughter, and—“A jolly good idea too, Kiddie!” from
the other of my employer’s “loud relations,” his odious uncle. “Very pretty,
Theo!”

“Yes, I thought it would be rather sweet! Doesn’t _Billy_?” said the child, with
a half-defiant look towards the Head of the House, who looked—there is no
denying it—as if he were longing to kick someone. He _did_ kick—a smothered yelp
from under the table told me what. He had vented some of his feelings upon the
little dog whose name meant “Sweetheart” in Welsh—who came from that port—one of
those by the sea! where there are two cottages and a wooden woman—whatever that
meant! The taller of the parlour-maids, handing lobster _soufflé_ to her master,
wasn’t wooden enough, nor quick enough in repressing her smile. A glare of
reproof was her portion as he refused the dish, and a peremptory, “Move
that—er—thing. It’s in the way!” with a jerk towards the silver pot that held
the spraying conservatory plant. “_Oh_, what a shame!” protested Theo loudly, as
this emblem was borne away. “And I’d specially _put_ it so that it _shouldn’t_
be in his way when he wanted to look at Nancy!”

“‘_Comes there much more of it?_’” I quoted to myself, but I caught Major
Montresor’s eye; he was looking puzzled, almost sorry for me! And that nerved me
up to laughing (I flatter myself, quite naturally!) as I murmured to Theo that
she was a sentimental little goose! “Sentimental? A good thing if she is!” took
up Theo’s irrepressible uncle. “I like it. In these highly-educated days it’s a
good sign! Yes, I like to see the young folks still taking an interest in
watching a real Romance, instead of stuffing up their heads with nothing but
mixed hockey and hunger-strikes and rubbish of that sort! That never brought a
girl a sweetheart yet, _did_ it, Mary? _Does_ it, Nancy? And that’s all a girl’s
there for, when you get down to bedrock. I may be a bit behind the times——”

As he was the only person talking at the table, he was considerably “behind”
with his dinner. Unheeding, he discoursed on all through the _entrée_ and the
saddle of mutton. “Yes! I may be hackneyed and old-fashioned, but that’s what I
feel. What do you say, Major?”

What chance had the Major of saying anything? The whole conversation had been
pretty equally divided between the two _enfants terribles_—the girl of thirteen
and the man of sixty. “Plenty of Romance in our young days! All over for us now!
Still, we enjoy seeing the rising generation keep it up! Good luck to ’em. White
heather for luck, eh? Yes, yes! Must have one of those little sprigs in my
button-hole—memento of a very happy occasion!—Bless my soul, everybody finished
except me? I talk too much, ha-ha!—must get on.”

He went on eating very quickly, talking between mouthfuls. “‘Mock-orange,’ eh?
Capital! Hope it won’t be long before we all see _real_ orange-blossom, a wreath
of it, round the pretty head of a certain young lady in white! Yes! dash it all,
Mary, I must drink that in champagne.”

He took champagne. So did I. I felt I was going to need it! Mrs. Waters let it
foam and sizzle into her glass; Blanche, though murmuring that the horrid stuff
always reminded her of seltzer-water that the knives had been washed in, sipped
at it for the sake of the “occasion.” Major Montresor took it—reverting
afterwards to his invariable whisky and soda. The only “grown-up” who didn’t
take it was my employer. Still Waters refused his usual peg and drank plain
water. Every now and then he seemed to be making spasmodic efforts to remember
that he had guests under his roof; but they weren’t successful! This added to my
discomfort! I saw his mother glance at him, but only once, and with a half-
humorous little smile! Didn’t she _mind_ the fact of the host remaining well
over the verge of unmitigated sulks? Apparently not! Possibly she’s seen him in
his tantrums before now—even though she didn’t know the reason of these! I was
feeling almost thankful that one of the guests was such a host in himself;
thankful, up to a point, for Theo’s gusto! For the child who was “sitting-up”
grew more excited as each course was handed round. With her rose-flushed cheeks,
her tossed curls from which the white fillet had slipped crookedly down over one
eyebrow, her roving brown gaze, and her giggling spirits that raced higher and
higher with the bubbles in the glasses (of the others), she was the model of an
infant Bacchante. “Sitting-up!” It was her wretched brother whom she was causing
to sit up, and his still more wretched official _fiancée_! The only thing to do
was for both of us to rise to the situation. Only he wouldn’t—or couldn’t. So,
once more _I_ had to. There is after all a certain relief in feeling you’ve
reached the climax of all things, and that Fate _cannot_ have anything worse in
store! And this I _did_ feel when Uncle Albert, having tossed off his toast,
expressed a wish to know what sort of place the young folks fancied for their
honeymoon. “Oh, the Riviera!” was what I rushed into the breach with here. “It
would be so glorious to see palms and flowering oleanders, and casinos, and
scent all growing wild!—I mean the Parma violets for it—against a brilliant blue
sea—such a treat to see a really bright blue bay and golden sunshine in the
middle of winter——”

“Winter?” put in Uncle Albert quite indignantly. “But my dear, we’re well on
into June now; you aren’t going to keep this poor Billy of yours”—with a wave of
the hand towards the head of the table—“waiting for his wedding till November or
December, _surely_?”

“Oh—er—why not?—we thought so.”

“We thought—that is, Miss—er—_she_ said,” blurted out the Governor desperately,
“that a year’s engagement was——”

“Far too long, my boy!” interrupted his uncle peremptorily, “far too long! Don’t
you give in to her about that! Why wait, Billy? What the dickens is there to
wait _for_? (What’s this—ice? No, thanks.) Why, when I was a fine young fellow
of your age, if I’d got a bonnie girl like that to look kindly at me, and enough
money to keep her in style, I’d not have rested until I’d clapped a plain gold
ring on the top of those diamonds on her finger. Nothing like settling down
happily as soon as you’ve got the chance. Like that picture—what is it—oh, you
know! Finest picture that ever was painted, I consider—in the Royal Academy
years ago—prints of it in every shop-window—what’s the name of the thing?”

“‘_My friend Mr. White_’?” suggested the Major. “No, no; _what_ the dickens is
it? A really beautiful thing, now, if I could only remember——”

“‘_Hope_,’ by G. F. Watts?” put in the Governor’s mother softly. “No!”

“‘_Harmony_’?” suggested Blanche. “‘_Simple Aveu_’—no—‘_The Soul’s Awakening_,’
Uncle Albert?” fortissimo from Theo. “No—none o’ those. You all know it, though.
I shall think of the name in a minute. Anyhow, I shall give these two young
people the best print to be got of it, to hang up in their hall.”

And his prominent grey eyes seemed to be staring over my head at some imaginary
plan of this entrance! “Only, they must hurry up, mind! No more of this nonsense
about their waiting a twelve-month and courting all the love away! Happy’s the
wooing that’s not long a-doing: isn’t that right, Major?”

“Quite, quite!” Major Montresor got his word in edge-ways at last. “To my
sorrow” (old humbug!) “be it spoken! You see, Waters, the longer you play your
fish, the more likely he—that is, _she_—is to get away! You’ve got to put on all
the strain your tackle will bear at _once_!”

“Hear that, Bill?” (The Governor was looking as if _he_ would not be able to
stand much more strain of this kind.) “Put it all on at once—excellent advice!
And where are you going to have the wedding, Mary? Here, I daresay?”

“_I_ had hoped so,” said Mrs. Waters, with her pretty smile at me. “Oh, yes;
_here_, Uncle Albert!” cried Blanche, who, I know, would regard this wedding as
a dress-rehearsal of her own. And then she and Theo began to enlarge, in a kind
of two-part pæon, on this function that will never be. “A big tent on the
lawn——”

“Red carpet across the gravel——”

“A _huge_ wedding-cake just in that very place”—with a bacchanalian gesture
towards the mirrored table-centre. “All the lovely presents put out in the
den——”

“Too small, Blanche! I know Uncle Albert will want to give them _all_ his
furniture.”

“In mother’s bedroom, then! We could easily get it to look like not that at
all!”

“Yes, and Billy and Nancy standing up in the drawing-room together for all the
people to look at and shake hands with, and kiss——”

(Here a sound as of the word “Pup-chick!” from the other parlourmaid, who was
disposing the finger-glasses.) “Yes, and showers of confetti dropping out of
everybody’s hat for weeks afterwards——”

“And the band playing like anything all the time—_all_ the wedding-marches and
glides and rag time and all the waltzes that make you feel you _must_ dance——”

“And a white satin slipper tied on to the back of the motor when they go away——”

“Yes! One of mine, so’s you can see it! Oh, won’t it be a gorgeous day!”
trumpeted Theo, bounding up and down as if wire springs only held her to her
chair. “Oh, _why_ isn’t it going to be next week? Still, even this evening is
_almost_ as good as a sort of wedding-breakfast! Don’t you think so, everybody?
With Nancy looking so sweet in that dress, and the way I’ve done the table, and
the champagne, and everything? Only, in one way”—crescendo—“it’s _better_!
Because, if it were the _real_ wedding, the bride and bridegroom would be
leaving us to-night! And as it is, they’re staying on,” concluded Theodora, with
a peal of rapturous laughter, “and there’ll be _no_ horrid good-byes to say, and
_no_ crying!”

“_Won’t_ there!” came from the straight lips of her brother, in a grimmer and
more deadly tone than even I had ever heard. “_You’ll_ be crying, miss, before
the evening’s over.”

And, to anticipate a little, she _was_. In half an hour or so, the easily-
wounded heart of thirteen was being sobbed out on her pillow. For when, after
the gratifications of a “quite grown-up bow” from Major Montresor and a prophecy
from Uncle Albert that it wouldn’t be many years now before Theo had a wedding-
breakfast-table of her own to decorate, the child had turned a glowing face up
to her brother’s, she had received only the curtest of “good nights” dropped
over his shoulder. *       *       *       *       *

To me the thought of that farewell glimpse of him was nothing less than a
reprieve. “Thank goodness that, as he’s got two men-guests to attend to, it’ll
be the last of him that I shall be obliged to put up with this evening!” thought
I, as I rose to follow Mrs. Waters. “He’ll have to disappear into the den or the
billiard-room with _them_. _I_ shall have an evening off. Yes! a regular
‘evening off,’ like the maids! Only, I suppose, a housemaid uses those evenings
to _see_ her young man. With me, it’s just the other way round. ‘No followers
allowed’ indeed! ‘Nothing BUT following’ has been my trouble. So hurray for a
nice peaceful evening in the drawing-room with his mother and Blanche. After
that _ghastly_ meal, how I shall enjoy the rest!”

Even as I was congratulating myself upon it, my hopes were again dashed to the
ground—this time, of course, by the hand of Uncle Albert. “No, no, Billy. The
Major and I are too old not to let you have your bit of time to yourselves now,
aren’t we, Montresor?”

“_Rather!_” with hollow geniality from the Major. Apparently it’s one thing for
a man to mention his “declining years” and add about fifteen of them to his age.
It’s quite another to find himself claimed as a contemporary by a man who’s ten
years older than he is! “We two old fogies can look after ourselves, my boy.
We’re not going to keep you in here, away from your girl. Not a word!—that’s
quite all right—quite understood! Been young ourselves once, though you may not
believe it—off with you!”

And, to my unspeakable fury, he closed the dining-room door upon what he’s
pleased to call “these young people.” The door of the drawing-room had already
been shut upon Mrs. Waters and Blanche! Was there to be _no_ respite, then,
after the awful meal I had just sat through? A nice evening it had been—this
dinner which I suppose had been meant to be so jolly for all of us, as well as
for the two guests! Well! at the end of it all here was Major Montresor piqued;
Theo in tears; the parlour-maids glared at, and Cariad kicked! Even Uncle Albert
hadn’t been able to remember the name of the horrible picture, whatever it was,
that he meant to give “us.”

And now here was I, left stranded once more face to face with my fuming
employer; only, this time, with the memory of that child’s light-hearted mockery
of stage-management between us! CHAPTER XVIII

THE FIRST KISS

“Well! I suppose there is nothing for it but to go in here,” I said, marching,
with my head well up, to the door of the den. The Governor was only just in time
to open it for me. Without a look at him I walked in, making straight for the
piano-stool. I sat down. I planted my foot firmly upon the loud pedal. My
fingers clutched at the first chords of a spirited war-song as if it were a
life-buoy. “Do sing!” I heard myself fling almost imperiously at my employer. He
sang—not well. “And please keep on singing,” I said, into the last chords of the
song. “_Loud_ ones, please.”

Without any further conversation, we went doggedly through “_Drake’s Drum_” and
“_The Two Grenadiers_.”

I simply wasn’t going to let Uncle Albert Waters, left in the dining-room with
Major Montresor, imagine that his nephew and I had gone into the den to—to make
anything but—music for one single instant that evening. Let them hear for
themselves that we were busy at the piano the whole time! They could hear well
enough through the wall of the dining-room——

No! Apparently they couldn’t hear well enough. For no sooner had we come to the
end of those bars of the “_Marseillaise_” that conclude the Grenadier song, than
the door of the den was thrown open and in walked those two other men. Uncle
Albert, of course in advance, pranced up to the piano, thumped his fist into the
open palm of the other hand, leaned over the piano towards us, then, in a
solemn, confidential, impressive tone of voice, he brought out—one word. It was
the word:

“_Wedded!_”

“What?” rapped out the Governor, sharply wheeling round. And I couldn’t help
gasping, wondering if this old gentleman had suddenly come under some
hallucination about our being more, even, than merely “engaged.”

“Yes. ‘Wedded,’” repeated Uncle Albert, raising his voice again to its normal
blare. “You know!—The fellow and the girl! That first-rate picture by Millais or
Holman Hunt or one of ’em. Anyhow, you know it. She’s got her head resting right
back against the young chap’s shoulder, like this”—

(Unsuccessful imitation of the pose of Leighton’s model by Uncle Albert against
the piano.) —“And he’s lifting her hand to his mouth—_you_ know. That’s the one.
That’s the name I was puzzling over half through dinner, and it only just dawned
upon me just as I finished my cigar. I had to come in and tell you. And, if
we’re not _de trop_,” added that appalling old man, settling down like a big
collapsible toy in one of the huge arm-chairs, “we’d like to hear just one tune
in here. ‘If he’s only _singing_,’ as I said to the Major, ‘he might just as
well have company by as not, and I’m fond of a good song after dinner!’ So now,
Billy, what have you got there? D’you know that A 1 thing—ah, what is it? What a
man I am for forgetting names! Something bandy—not Bandy-legs——”

“Ha!” Major Montresor, from the other big chair, came to the rescue. “‘_The
Bando-lero_’!”

“That’s it! Know it, William? ‘I _am_ the Bando-lero!’” vociferated Uncle
Albert, “‘the—something—Bando-lero——’”

“I know it,” said my employer, with restraint, “but I haven’t got it in the
house!”

It was my turn to suppress a smile as I remembered how, in my nursery-days, I’d
defined “_a bandolero_” as “_a person with a very loud voice_,” just as
naturally as I used to think that “_a Radical_” meant “_a dreadfully wicked
man_.” It was the very song that I could imagine Uncle Albert enjoying singing
himself. A pity his nephew didn’t happen to have it in the house! “You have
this, though,” I suggested helpfully, as I turned to the rack and took out “_The
Storm-Fiend_,” with a look at the Governor meaning, “Don’t dare to say you
loathe this thing!” (It was because he did, by the way, that the song had been
ordered for him in a burst of unsisterliness by Theo.) “Yes! _You_ can look soft
nothings at the girl, my boy!” was Uncle Albert’s interpretation of that glance
of the Governor’s as I spoke, “but she’s got to keep those pretty dark eyes of
hers for the music!”

(—And I wonder the sheet of music didn’t shrivel up under the gaze of the eyes
thus praised!) We then proceeded to dash through “_The Storm-Fiend_.” I wondered
whether the Governor found in the loud singing of it as much of a safety-valve
as I found in the playing of the artillery-like accompaniment! “Bravo! Very
good! Stirring song, that!” Uncle Albert’s bellow swelled the echoes of the last
chord. “Capital song—very well sung. I like that tune—‘_I chuckle and laugh, ho,
ho! I chuckle and laugh, ho, ho!_’” he persisted (to some tune quite of his
own). “‘_The Storm-Fiend is the Lord—of—Woe!_’ Very good! Still, not very
appropriate for to-night, Billy? Not much Woe about this evening, my dear, eh?”
(to me). “Supposing we have a bit of sentiment now. What was that other song,
now? I was talking about it only at tea-time here—something tally-ho-ish that we
could all join in the chorus of.”

But here I felt I simply must nip in the bud a request for the one about—

“_All my Fancy dwells upon Nancy._”

“Nancy” had had _enough_! So I rose, saying gently, “If you will excuse me, I am
rather tired”—

This was no fib! —“and I think I will go to bed early. Good night, Mr. Waters,”
politely to that awful Uncle Albert. “Good-bye, Major Montresor; so nice to have
seen you again like this.... Good-night,” with a little nod to my official
_fiancé_. “‘_Be the day weary, be the day long_....’” I thought. But we hadn’t
_even yet_ come to the end of it. For Uncle Albert Waters had bounded up again
from the deep chair like a large india-rubber ball, with yet another protest to
his nephew. “What’s that? what’s that? Ah, but that’ll never do. Never!”
reverberated through the den. “You’re never going to let the girl go off like
that, Billy?—Just a word and a nod?”

Good heavens—what could he mean? “Why! She’d never think anything of you again,
lad! Never mind two old has-beens like us. We don’t count, do we, Major? Don’t
you take any notice of us. You kiss your sweetheart good night, like a sensible
youngster!” And before I could escape, before either of us had fully realized
what this terrible, bellowing, stout, red-faced, eyes-on-stalked, cigar-scented,
coarse, _horrid_ old man would take it into his head to say or do next, he had
literally pushed us into each other’s arms. I don’t know whether it was for a
minute or for half a second that I was given over to feeling the true horror of
this position; to wondering what on earth my make-believe _fiancé_ meant me to
do about it—what _he_ meant to do. Then he—the Governor—decided the matter for
me. With the suddenest of movements he ducked swiftly forward and bent, without
further look or word, to kiss me. I was too petrified to draw back even the
fraction of an inch from the touch of his lips; it brushed by, scarcely stirring
on my cheek, to fall almost roughly on the ripple of dark hair above my ear.
Then he bolted to the door and held it open for my headlong exit from the den.
To the sound of an explosive “_That’s_ more like it!” from Uncle Waters. “You
surely never——” (Slam! from the door) I tore across the hall. I didn’t pause for
any more good nights in the drawing-room. I rushed upstairs to my bedroom. Here
I flung myself down into one of the rosy-chintz chairs by the open window and
gasped while I tried to collect my whirling wits. *       *       *       *
*

What _had_ happened? What was he—that young man—doing to _allow_ anything to
happen? His “official” _fiancée_? Was this what he meant by “official”—it wasn’t
what _I_ meant, and I would let him know that. I was furious with him—His
uncle’s fault?—Yes! But he ought to have managed so that _That_ wasn’t thrust
upon me like this. I _was_ angry! Then I couldn’t help laughing a little at the
mad incongruity of it. Kissed, by Still Waters! What could he think I thought of
it? What was _he_ thinking about it all now, downstairs there with those other
two horrible men? What was his Uncle Albert thinking? Chuckling and laughing,
ho, ho! I expected....

That ghastly moment! That ghastly, _ghastly_ moment!... Thank goodness that the
Governor did at least end it as soon as was humanly possible. And, after all,
that quick gesture of his hardly counts as a kiss. I’ve seen the love-scenes in
private theatricals carried out just like that by bashful amateurs. A stage-
kiss; a sham one; in fact, no kiss at all. Well, that, anyhow, was decent of
Still Waters.... But _was_ it? Was he thinking of _my_ feelings? I don’t believe
he was. I believe—at least, a month ago I might have believed—with the rest of
the girls at the office, that that would be his only conception of kissing a
girl. I can’t believe that now—not of a brother of Theo’s and Blanche’s—not of a
son of Mrs. Waters’s! His father, Blanche said, was so devoted to her ... their
boy would have inherited some sort of idea of the real thing! Besides, a young
man who’s already surprised me by being able to sing like that, and to be keen
on dancing, and to win swimming competitions, and to look, sometimes, quite
_human_! Oh, no! It was _meant_ for being decent. He’d scarcely touched
me—except just on the hair. Then I felt furious again. My hair—my pet vanity—the
prettiest thing about me! Once Sydney Vandeleur begged me for a piece of it to
keep—that piece with the ripple—as if I’d cut it! If I had, it wouldn’t have got
kissed....

Hateful, clumsy, blundering, or _something_ young man! He _needn’t_ have kissed
me at all! He _could_ have got out of it—in spite of his detestable old uncle.
Couldn’t he have seemed to think that I was too shy to let him in public, and
allowed me to slip away? Or couldn’t he have followed me into the hall and shut
the door and _pretended_? Or couldn’t he have hatched up some joke on the spur
of the moment and announced cheerfully—

“Oh, we don’t say our good nights in here, Uncle; outside in the veranda is
where we say good night”—or something like that? Easily. Then what did he mean
by it? Was it that this excruciating evening, with its countless trials, had
worn his patience absolutely through, and that he felt he must vent his fury on
something besides Cariad? Was that kiss a kind of “let-fly” at _me_? How
frightfully unfair! As if I’d done anything but rush into breaches and make the
best of things for him! Good gracious! I shall tell him exactly what I think of
it all to-morrow! *       *       *       *       *

But the evening held one last trial for me before I was able to slip into that
springy snowdrift of a bed and lie tossing, indignantly awake, for quite an hour
after I’d heard the motor puff off, taking Major Montresor to catch his last
train up to town. This trial was heralded by a tap at my door. Enter Blanche in
her _débutante’s_ dinner-gown. “How early you’re going to bed, Nancy! We thought
you were still with Billy, but Uncle Albert’s taken him on at billiards—he says
he’s playing worse than anyone he’s ever seen. Is anything the matter, dear?”

“Oh, no—nothing; why?”

“You look so flushed—I thought you might have a headache.”

A headache—ah! valuable antique feminine excuse for everything! “Yes—perhaps I
have, a little.”

“Poor darling! Everybody _did_ seem to be talking at once at dinner, and Uncle
Albert _is_ such a fog-horn, enough to go through anybody’s head. Let me brush
your hair for you, will you?”

I had to let her. “It’ll be better with all these pins and clips out,” said
Blanche, unfastening and shaking loose. “Goodness, what lots you’ve got! It’s
like yards and yards of black skein-silk. And _how_ lovely and soft.”

And here, in the looking-glass, I saw the girl’s face, blonde and clear-featured
as her brother’s, pressed for a moment to the ripple of dark hair above my ear.
It must have looked something like that just now to those two other men in the
den....

Then I saw my own face turn scarlet. Blanche Waters saw that too. “Oh, sorry,”
she murmured, with a little “understanding” smile. “Mustn’t I?”

She might just as well have _said_, “Mustn’t anybody except Billy kiss you just
there?”

—Which did, as my brother Jack would say, put the lid on it! Well! to-morrow I
am going to put my foot down, very firmly, on anything more of _this_ sort!
CHAPTER XIX

THE FIRST HANDSHAKE

This morning I was just finishing dressing when I heard a blackbird’s whistle,
two or three times repeated, just outside my window. It interrupted my
meditations on a rather interesting subject. Namely: What was my employer going
to say to me to-day about that episode last night? How—in what spirit, in what
words, would he make his apology? Of course I know that for the offence of
having kissed a girl who is nothing to him there _is_ no apology a man can make.
The mere suggestion of apologizing for that is adding insult to injury. The only
possible excuse is to say: “_I don’t expect you to forgive me, but I couldn’t
help myself_”—allowing an unspoken—“_and I’d do it again if I had the chance_”
to be interpreted by the tone in which it was spoken. However, _that_ was quite
out of the question here, seeing that there had been no kiss of that sort in the
affair. The offence, however, was just as inexcusable; more so. To have kissed
me on the hair—why, even as I took up my brushes before the glass this morning I
saw the reflection of another angry wave of scarlet in my face brought there by
the memory which can’t be just brushed away. It might not have been so
infuriating if it hadn’t been the first time....

For I’d never before allowed any man to attempt such a thing. I’ve always known
that one ought to stick to what Lady Mary Wortley-Montague says in that little
poem:

“He _comes too near_ who _comes to be denied_!”

I remembered that last night, as I lay awake; remembered quoting it to Cicely
Harradine. She had laughed and turned rather pink—this was after some dance we’d
both been to at the Slade—and had said, “Yes, Tots dear; that is so sweet—and so
awfully true, of course; only—it _was_ in the eighteenth century, dear, wasn’t
it? and isn’t it _rather_ what you call ‘a Counsel of Perfection?’”

It oughtn’t to be so—it needn’t have been so for me, but now—that’s all been
spoilt—and by _him_! What can he say about it? “Nothing else for it—my uncle’s
doing.”—Yes, but I’ve got all my answers for _that_ excuse. “I was goaded into
it by having had such an awful evening; felt I must do something outrageous.”
Yes, but not _that_! I had had an awful evening too! And _I_ hadn’t wanted to
kiss anybody! “Hadn’t time to think of anything else.”

Nonsense! A business man with his wits sharpened by daily interviews with other
sharp-witted people for whose benefit he has to think out, even while he’s
speaking, excuses, schemes, promises, goodness knows what! Oh, he’d have to say
something more convincing than that to me! Again I heard the whistle—a
monotonous note for a blackbird’s! Then came a sharp tap at my opened, latticed,
wistaria-garlanded casement. A pebble had been flung up against it. This gave me
quite a little jump; it brought back old days at home; when Sydney, staying in
the house, had wanted to bring me out for a stroll before breakfast. “Must be
Theo,” I said aloud to myself. But something told me it wasn’t. I looked out.
Yes. There on the gravel beneath, in a blue serge suit that seemed to make his
sleek head shine quite golden in the morning sunshine, stood my employer,
looking up. Waiting for me to come out? Throwing stones up to catch my
attention? Who taught him that? “Good morning,” he said quietly. “Will you come
down when you are ready?”

I nodded as ungraciously as I could, and drew back at once. I was quite ready,
but I stopped dead-still by the wardrobe glass for a long moment, letting him
wait. Then I turned to the door. Then I came back again. I took the shadiest hat
I’ve got out of its drawer and pulled it down firmly over my hair, stabbing it
on with my swastika hatpin, my hand-wrought silver one that Sydney designed for
me, my two mounted regimental buttons of father’s, and my little pearl-headed
one. I daresay my head did look all bristling with spikes, like the Statue of
Liberty’s. But if I’d had more pins I’d have stuck them _all_ in! And even if I
do, like Blanche and Theo, usually go about hatless in the gardens, I was going
to use all the “cover” I could to meet the Governor’s apology, whatever it might
be. For _now_ he was going to have his work cut out for him! And whatever he
began to say about last night’s brusque, snatched kiss, I wasn’t going to help
him out by one syllable. I could wait. Let him explain; floundering about for
words, probably, as he hasn’t floundered yet! Feeling most satisfactorily
composed myself, I came down the stairs. One of the maids, in china-blue print,
moved aside a dust-pan for me to pass. Then I saw something that ruffled me
again. In that dust-pan there was a handful of pink, crystallized rose-leaves
and a couple of tiny silver horseshoes—Theodora’s “confetti!” It must have
dropped out of the draping of my skirt as I rushed upstairs—was there no getting
away from last night?—and I know that there was something more than well-trained
civility in that girl’s smiling “Good morning, Miss Nancy!”

Why can’t they say “Miss Trant”? Do they consider it isn’t worth while for so
short a time, as they think?—_Hateful_ household! I had only just unruffled
myself again as I faced the Governor in the sunshine outside. “Come in here,
won’t you?” he said, holding open the little white gate under the rambler arch
of the rose-garden. It was just then a bouquet of warm, scented colour, shading
down from the deepest damask of the bed of Jeune Amours, through the rosy,
straggling Baroness von Ulks and the faintly-flushed Cuisses des Nymphes to the
dead-white Frau Karl Druschkis—such a rose-garden, such an earthly paradise for
a before-breakfast stroll—_alone_! Side by side we paced slowly down to the end
of the box-bordered path between the pink Maman Cochets (another echo of last
night!) before another word was said. Then he began. “I wanted to have this
opportunity of saying something to you.”

His tone was conciliatory, quiet. The expression of his face was—well, not in
the least his mask of office-hours, nor the scowling barricade he put up at last
night’s dinner-table; but guarded and absolutely non-committal. So was mine, I
hope. I waited for him to go on. “I may tell you,” he went on, “that I’ve been
regretting—”

Last night, I supposed? A curious way of _putting_ it! —“regretting for some
time that it was you I asked to take on this—this situation for me.”

“Oh!”

We turned and walked back again. “I mean,” he added quietly, “that I regret
having dragged a girl of your kind, more sensitive and spirited than I had
imagined—”

What _had_ he imagined, then? —“into this affair.”

“Oh.”

“I—I suppose I ought to have known better than to ask—_you_.”

“Oh,” I said, for the third time, and I meant to stop there. But somehow I
couldn’t help going on rather acidly, “And which of your other employees do you
wish you had asked instead? Miss Robinson?”

(Who would have been provided with material for impersonations of the family
Waters for the rest of her life.) —“Or Miss Holt?”

(_She_, I know, would have screamed aloud when he inflicted that extraordinary
kiss upon her!) “Miss Smith, of course, has her affections otherwise engaged——”

“Ah? And so that would have been a barrier, would it? Even to this kind of an
affair?” retorted the Governor, very quickly and looking hard at me. I knew what
he meant. He was thinking of the Major’s clumsy bringing-up, yesterday, of the
name of Sydney Vandeleur. So I lifted my eyes, which had been idly studying the
grey pattern of shadow flung by a trellised rose-arch upon my creamy skirt, and
I looked the Governor firmly in the face as I said quietly:

“I imagine so.”

Then _he_ said, “Oh.”

And then there was another pause. Surely Mr. Waters could not break it by
anything else, now, than by coming to the point—saying whatever it was he meant
to say about his behaviour at the door of the den? But nothing of the kind. “You
quite understand, then, that I am sorry—for bringing you into all this?” he
began again. “Right. Now, I suppose I ought to offer to release you from the
arrangement.”

“Yes?” I looked up again quickly, hopefully. “Only, you see, I can’t,” my
employer concluded, slowly. “I can’t do that. The—er—my—the reason which forced
me into it is—still there.”

“Oh.”

Another turn. This time towards the pergola. “Another thing,” he went on—and
this time I really did think I knew what was coming next. “About last night.”

I didn’t say, “Oh”—I simply waited for whatever apology he thought fit to make.
“Last night, in the drawing-room before dinner. I’m afraid I was rather rude.”

“_Before_ dinner?” I echoed, forgetting what could have happened then. “Yes;
when you were asking me about that place in Wales, Porth Cariad,” he said. “I
told you, rather off-handedly, I’m afraid, that there was ‘a wooden woman’
there.”

“Oh, yes!”

“Well, there is. It’s the figure-head of a ship, some vessel that was wrecked in
the bay, years ago,” explained the Governor quite simply. “They’ve put it up
beyond the two cottages there, on the cliff. I ought to have explained that at
the time.”

Well! And wasn’t there anything else he had to explain? With all these “Oh’s”
and pauses, he was a long, long time in coming to that unjustifiable kiss—and
yet something convinced me that his mind was full of it even while he mentioned
these other things first. “Besides that,” he went on deliberately, “there’s
something I was thinking over last night, for quite a time before I went to
sleep.”

Ah! At last! “I wanted to suggest——” he was saying, when, from behind the leafy
screen of the pergola there came a booming cry of:

“Aha! Here they are! here they are! Might have known what they were at! Love
among the roses, eh?”

And in another moment there hove into view the rotund, white-waistcoated form
and the rosy John Bull face, smiling under the light grey, dented felt hat, of
Uncle Albert Waters. Beaming and rubbing his hands, he advanced upon us. “Now,
young people, young people! Breakfast’s ready! Didn’t hear the gong, eh? No, of
course not. Something better to listen to, as I said. _I_ heard you, Billy! I
heard you whistling under her window half an hour ago! Something worth while
being an early bird for now, what? But come along.”

He slipped one arm into his nephew’s, the other into mine, and wheeled us round
towards the house. “I told your mother I’d come out myself and fetch you in!”

Perfectly unconscious that if wishes could have killed he must have fallen down
shrivelled to a cinder on the garden path, he rolled on happily between us
towards the French windows of the dining-room, prattling robustiously all the
way. “Nothing comes up to that nine-o’clock-in-the-morning smell of bacon and
coffee, does it? Smells far better than it tastes, they say! Which reminds me
that I once heard a young lady, Nancy, my dear—only she was a cynical young
person, not nearly so pretty—I heard her say that the best part of frizzling
bacon was like Love—all in the anticipation! Never tasted as good as it promised
to, so to speak! Of course you don’t agree with her?”

“No, oh, _no_!” I cried hastily, partly because I felt I must disagree with
somebody, partly because I realized that the inevitable effect of this
detestable old man upon his nephew was to strike him dumb when he ought to have
spoken! “Ah, quite right, quite right!” responded Uncle Albert, with an
affectionate pressure of my arm in his. “_That’s_ the attitude! I don’t believe
in this modern plan of analysing everything down to nothing, do you?”

“_Hate_ it,” I said viciously—meaning that I hated having my arm squeezed by
horrible relations-in-law never-to-be. “I see you do! Good! My dear, I’m
delighted to find that Billy’s sweetheart sees eye to eye with Billy’s uncle on
so many points. That’s why I’m taking you out this morning—Oh, yes! you too, my
boy! Not going to separate the turtle-doves!—going to take you both out if you
can beg mother off from church. I’m going to motor you over—not a hundred miles
away, and show you something—Aha! Something that I fancy you will approve of as
much as I do!”

“Heavens! What will this new horror turn out to be?” thought I; catching the
same question in the Governor’s eye as we entered the dining-room, where the
family, including Cariad, was already at breakfast, and sat down to the coffee
and bacon of old Mr. Waters’ disgusting metaphor. We weren’t long spared the
answer to that question. “Now, Mary! I’ve just been telling our two young people
here,” began Uncle Albert almost at once, “that they’re going over in the car
with me this fine morning to look at something I particularly want them to see.
Now, I’ll give you three guesses what it is—No, I won’t—”

(Interrupting Theo, who had leapt up in her chair with a shriek of “Wedding
presents! That picture!”)

“—I want the pleasure of telling you myself. Picture? No, child. Something to
put the picture in—to _be_ the picture in, ho, ho! It’s a house to let!”

“A _house_!” murmured Blanche, clasping her hands, and obviously seeing herself
helping to arrange the flowers in it. “A charming house, only fifteen miles from
here. Just the place for Billy and his Nancy to settle down in when they get
married,” enlarged the elderly _enfant terrible_. “In fact, once they’ve seen
it, they’ll want to motor on and order that special licence at once, I shouldn’t
wonder!”

Mercy! I turned my eyes to Mrs. Waters, as if imploring her help to change the
conversation; she only nodded and smiled and murmured: “Pretty blouse—I always
like you in lacy white things, Nancy!”

There was no checking Uncle Albert; on he went:

“I was looking at the place only last week, and it’s still going! There’s a
rose-garden, my dear, almost as prettily arranged as the one here that you were
billing and cooing in just now. And a splendid vegetable garden for the more
practical side of life. South aspect!—Very excellent fish-curry, Mary—Nice, airy
bedrooms! _And_”—his voice took on an impressive rallentando—“Now, what do you
think? A little—a little white wicket-gate at the top of the stairs! That’s the
crowning touch, eh?”

Yes. It was. “That was what took _my_ fancy, you know! I immediately said to
myself——”

At all costs, I felt, must Uncle Albert be kept from repeating what he had said
to himself. “Yes—But, Mr. Waters,” I interrupted wildly, “I’m so afraid that
that house wouldn’t—couldn’t do for _us_!”

“What, my dear! Why not? If you only see it, you’ll say as I did——”

“I’m sure it’s perfectly lovely,” I burst in; “but the fact of the matter is
that we—we have arranged to live in London”—“and in separate houses for ever,” I
might have added. I went on improvising rapidly. “You see, we shall have a town
house for most of the year, and for the summer we’re looking round for a sort
of—of farmhouse, with two cottages by the sea, you know! In—in Anglesey, I
think. I am so fond of—of that part of the country, so—Those were our plans,
aren’t they?” I concluded, with one reckless “Say so, _do_!” glance at the
Governor. “Yes—rather! That’s what _we’d_ thought of!” he returned, with a
glance back at me which betrayed something very like pure gratitude. As well it
might! For again, just before I spoke, my employer had been at such an utter
loss that—for the first time since I’d seen him, I felt positively _sorry_ for
him. And I answered his glance with the tiniest nod of encouragement. They were
the first friendly signals that had ever passed between us. *       *       *
*       *

“Look here. I must speak to you.”

This was my employer, hurriedly to me after breakfast, in the veranda. Now, as
that deep, shady veranda is built all the way round the house, as every one of
the windows gives on to it, and as all the windows are always wide open, I
couldn’t help giving a look round it as much as to say, “Here?”

“Not here,” he muttered, still more hurriedly. “This seems to be the deuce of a
house to talk in—never saw such a place. And there’s no time now. My uncle was
going to take us along in the car——”

“_Must_ we go?” I asked, softly and ruefully, with my back to one of the
pillars. “No. I’ve knocked that on the head—I’m going to take him off by myself
to play golf. I said you’d really rather go to church with my mother and the
girls.”

“Oh, thanks so much,” I said fervently. “I certainly would!”

“So I thought. Well, then, we shall be lunching at the Club House—or, anyhow,
getting lunch somewhere out—not coming back here.”

I nearly said, “Thanks, so much!” once more. I also nearly smiled to think that
anyone else, catching sight of the two of us talking so quickly, so quietly, and
so close together under the soft mauve fringe of wistaria-blossom that drooped
from the glazed roof, might easily have imagined that our conspiracy was how to
spend most of this glorious Sunday _together_, instead of _apart_! “We might not
even be back for tea,” said the Governor. “And when is——” I paused and turned my
eyes towards the house, “_going_?”

“Six o’clock train back to town this evening,” said the Governor, looking
steadily at me. A “Thank goodness!” remained unuttered on the tip of my tongue,
as I felt obliged to say, “I hope he didn’t think it odd of me not to want to
see”—I brought it out with a jerk—“that house.”

“Oh, no! He seemed rather bucked, really, to hear that—well, that we were so far
on in our plans. Anglesey, you know, and so on,” said the Governor, in an
expressionless voice as I turned quickly away. For I’d caught the heralding
whiff of a cigar round the corner! Also, I wanted to be safely in my own room,
getting ready for church, just at the time that those two men would be setting
out for the links. My employer took one step after me. “This evening, then?—I
mean, for what I was going to say to you.”

Ah. That interrupted apology weighed on his mind. “Very well,” I said. “Good-
bye.”

And I drew a breath of relief to think of the whole blessed Day of Rest before
me. *       *       *       *       *

Even Church, however, wasn’t without its slight reminder of the situation. I was
feeling rested, soothed, lulled—and, I am afraid, not strictly attentive—when my
attention was caught, first by Theo’s moist palm being thrust into mine, much as
Cariad thrusts his nose, and then by a phrase in the voice of the officiating
curate:

“_I publish the banns of marriage between_——”

Banns, of course! Of course they must needs publish banns on this particular
Sunday and in this particular church! thought I, rather pettishly. Well, I
supposed it wasn’t really the Governor’s fault! and that there _are_ banns read
every week! The next words I heard were:

“_Also of Leonard Harris, bachelor_—”

Ah! I knew his name; it was the young man from the Waters’ butcher, who, as I
had already been told, was to marry the prettiest of the maids at The Lawn, the
one who was sweeping the stairs this morning. —“_and Ethel Mary Bell, spinster,
both of this parish._”

Both absurdly happy, probably, in a “Smithie” kind of way. I wondered if “he”
were red and greasy, like so many butchers? Whether he’d leave “her” at home
while he went and sat all the evening in the “Spotted Dog”? My young man—I
suppose to some people the Governor _would_ be my “young man”—isn’t that sort.
Not that it need make the slightest difference to _me_ if he were! I needn’t
worry about the sort of husband he’ll make—to someone else. “_Also between_——”

What a lot of engaged couples! Six, at least, were “called” to-day. And I
wondered about each of those six engaged girls.... Which of them had bloomed out
into what books call “_this strange new happiness that had come to her_” on HIS
account, and which of them just wanted to be “engaged” for its own sake? For
supposing an engagement were stripped of all its glamour of importance? Yes, my
dears! Take away the delight of discussing, with other girls, the possibilities
of finest nainsook and torchon. Take away the chance of growing positively left-
handed from showing off “his” ring. Take away the joy of being, instead of an
unattended wallflower at dances and parties, always more or less of a guarded
treasure. Take away that feeling of being at one and the same time much younger,
much older and much better-looking. Take away the comforting conviction that
_now_ you needn’t fret about what’s to become of you when you grow _passée_ and
“long in the tooth,” as Major Montresor unkindly calls various ex-favourites of
his own. Take all those “extras” away—and what remains of your pride and joy in
HIM alone? There’s a sum for the “really” engaged girl. I can’t help feeling I
can guess how it would work out in—say, four cases out of six! Perhaps I’m
wrong.... Perhaps the whole six of them would still go on feeling that _their_
unparalleled engagement had caused the sun to rise upon a new heaven and a
brand-new earth. But it’s odds, long odds, against any one of the six having an
“affair” in the least like—_mine_. And the curate went on reading out names.
“_Also_——”

“_Between William Waters, bachelor, of this parish_,” breathed his younger
sister in a gusty whisper, “_and Nancy Monica Trant, spinster_—of the parish of
what, Nancy?”

“S-sh! Theo!” I whispered, still wondering about those banns.... Would it come
to that? Would my employer feel himself obliged, before our twelve-months’
contract was up, to let those banns be actually published? “_If any of you know
any just cause or impediment why these persons should not be joined together in
Holy Matrimony_,” concluded the curate’s voice, “_ye are to declare it_.”

What in the world _was_ Mr. Waters going to “declare” about it to his family
when we reached that point? What just cause or impediment (except the real ones)
would he choose to “announce” as the bar to our getting married? Or would he,
just as he did this morning at breakfast, leave all explanations to _me_, and
reward me with a grateful look when I’d achieved them? Well!... Plenty of time
before _that_ happens....

*       *       *       *       *

To-night, though, there’d be that other explanation: his to me about
that—really, under the circumstances it might be called that _outrage_! Even yet
I hadn’t made up my mind how I was to accept what he should say. The only thing
left standing of all the many answers I’d considered and rejected was, “Well, it
must never happen again, that’s all!”

Even that doesn’t sound right, somehow. Perhaps something really clinching will
occur to me later. *       *       *       *       *

It was almost at the end of this Day of Rest that the Governor, extra sunburnt
and out-of-door-looking from the links, returned to find the women-folk of his
household—to which I suppose I must count myself as belonging officially—sitting
over that diminuendo of half-cups that marks the end of tea. “Has your uncle
gone, dear?”

“Yes; met some old crony of his and joined him for the journey home. If you tell
me where his bag is I’ll get it sent down to the station to meet the six,
Mother?”

“I’ll see to it now.”

She went out of the drawing-room—I _know_ with the usual gentle intention of
leaving the young people a minute to themselves after having been apart all day;
but before Theodora and Blanche could follow her, the Governor, saying that he
simply must change and get this dust off, disappeared himself. He disappeared
until supper-time. For late Sunday supper they don’t dress at The Lawn. So I was
still wearing my cream cloth costume with the white French blouse that Mrs.
Waters likes when the hour came which is given over to my official _fiancé_ and
myself. I’m quite hardened to this now. I supposed he would suggest the den. (I
hate that den.) But he didn’t. “Shall we go for a walk?” he said instead, “round
the lawn?”

“Yes.”

“Shall I fetch you a wrap to put over that frock?”

“Oh, no. It’s perfectly warm, thanks.”

“Oh.... Very well.”

And so, at the dusk of the day, just as in the morning sunshine of it, I found
myself pacing a garden path by his side, and wishing to goodness he’d get this
over, out of the way. He ought to be made to _grovel_, of course; that was as it
should be. But the longer he delayed mentioning that grotesque incident, the
more it _loomed_! It seemed to hang over my head like the shade of the trees
that bordered the further edge of the lawn, which we had now reached. The great
spread of turf was gleaming greyly in the dew. A bat, attracted by the whiteness
of my gown, flickered out of the shade and wheeled above us. “Well,” began the
Governor, “my uncle left all sorts of messages for you.”

He would, of course. Carefully refraining from asking what they were, I said
mildly, “Thank you.”

“He’s back in London by now.”

“Yes.”

“I suppose if he’d stayed on much longer,” observed my employer, in a detached
tone, “_you wouldn’t_!”

I said defensively, “I really _had_ been thinking I might find myself obliged to
go back to town at once!”

“After arranging to stay here for at least a fortnight,” he concluded quietly;
“after having given notice at the office—”

“The office” was good! Just as if “the office” meant anything but himself, Mr.
William Waters! —“and having no people of your own to consider—what should you
have said to mine?”

“I should have had to tell them that it was to—to attend a funeral!” I retorted,
with a memory of Mrs. Skinner. “Or”—here I checked the suggestion of getting my
hair singed and cut. I thought I’d better not begin by mentioning my hair! And I
added recklessly—“or that I’d got to go to the dentist’s and have every one of
my teeth out!”

“Rather than stay here in these circumstances. I see. Yes. I——Do you know, I
have felt uncommonly like that myself,” admitted my employer. “That’s what I’ve
been wanting to talk to you about. I thought it over last night, as I told you,
and I’ve been thinking about it again to-day.”

I wondered what sort of a game of golf he’d played. “It can’t go on like this!”
he said, suddenly stopping in our stroll and facing me in the deepening dusk
under the copper-beech. “I can’t stand it. It’s got a—a bit too thick!” he
concluded, quite schoolboyishly. Then he began again, incoherently, indignantly,
as if each word he said were a shell that held showers of bullets of other
words. “Theo’s tomfoolery! Those dashed flowers! My uncle and his—his remarks!”

“I know!” I said fervently. He turned on me again, and added unexpectedly, “And
_you_!”

“M-me?”

“Yes!” explosively. “You’re the worst of all—and you do know it! Because I’ve
let you in like, this—”

“They’ll hear you from the house—you really are like Theo sometimes.”

—“Because I’ve let you in,” sinking his voice and speaking once more calmly and
deliberately, “for lots of unpleasantnesses which nobody could have—well, which
_I_ never anticipated—you do all in your power to pay me back!”

“All that—at dinner last night,” I said virtuously, “was nothing to do with me.
You can’t say it was.”

“No, I admit it was Theo.... But it was all part and parcel of the same
impossible situation. Impossible! It can’t go on like this.”

“So you said before! But this morning you said you were unable to release me?”

“So I am. Which means that there’s only one other thing to be done about it,”
said my employer. I waited, wondering what on earth this might be. Utterly
unexpected was his next remark:

“Don’t you think you could manage to be—_friends_ with me?”

“_Friends?_” I repeated incredulously. Then something of his meaning began to
dawn upon me, and it was with a return of Manner B that I added: “I suppose you
mean ‘official’ friends?”

“No, I don’t,” he said rather tartly. (That manner never has been lost on him.)
“I mean, why can’t we be really friends and call ‘_Pax_’—for at least the time
that you’re here? Don’t you see how much better it would make it if we could
face these awkwardnesses together, instead of my knowing every time that you are
only waiting for the chance to rub it in and to get at me?”

This was all so foreign to his Near Oriental vocabulary that I nearly laughed.
But not quite. For it was being borne in upon me still more clearly that I
didn’t care for this suggestion of his at all. He was actually asking for my
help and co-operation, not in a sham rôle, but a _real_ one? Well, I thought,
what _cheek_! “If you mean,” I said, “that you want me to promise not to
‘rag’—not to—to banter you again about all this; not to go on saying things that
mean one thing for you and another to whoever else hears them, and all that——”

I was going to say that this I might promise; although I felt he was asking for
a good deal—for his official _fiancée’s_ one safety-valve, in fact! “No, no!
That’s not what I mean,” he put in. “When I say ‘friends,’ I mean it. Genuine
friends. On the terms we might be on if we weren’t en—if we hadn’t this
‘engagement’ between us.”

“How _can_ we be that?” said I emphatically. “Why can’t we?” he persisted. “Why?
Because I—I don’t see how I could be expected to answer such a question!”

He didn’t _say_, “You agreed to the other!” But I knew some men might. So I went
on trying to explain to this specially obtuse one. “Don’t you see how much
easier it is to pretend to be engaged or even—in love with a person, than to
turn round and _like_ them because you’re asked to?”

“Is it?”

“But of _course_ it is!” said I. “One _can_ act being—engaged and all that. One
can’t force oneself into friendship, real liking.” (Stupid, he was; it was just
like his not seeing the difference between accepting furs—and a frock!) “One
simply can’t make oneself _like_. That is asking too much. And I never bargained
for it. It wasn’t——”

—“In the arrangement,” I nearly said. I might just as well have said it! For:

“Damn—dash that infernal arrangement!” muttered my employer heatedly, crunching,
in the absence of Cariad, the well-kept gravel beneath his heel. “Can’t you
forget that, leave that alone for the time being? It would be so much easier——”

“Yes! For you perhaps!” I retorted. “But not easy for me; and it’s impossible
for me to feel like being ‘friends’ to order!”

He said nothing for a minute. Then he began again quietly. “You mean you dislike
me?”

“I don’t even know you well enough for really liking or disliking,” I argued
coldly. “And besides, what have we—you and I—in common, that we should expect to
get on well together?”

I knew what a hopeless question _that_ is to answer about almost any two
persons! He said rather helplessly, “Well, but hang it all! What have you in
common with——”

Here I _felt_, suspended between us in the dusk like a Mahomet’s coffin, the
name of Sydney Vandeleur! But the Governor changed his mind about uttering it.
He _said_:

“For instance, what can you have in common with a man like Montresor? You’re
twenty-one. He’s what?—Fifty? Sixty? Yet you can talk—you can——You seem to get
on all right with him.”

“Naturally!” I said. The Governor said nothing. He put up a hand and leaned
against a bough of the copper-beech under which we were standing. Well! It
seemed going to be a long discussion. I sat down on the garden bench a step or
so away, and turned my head to look at the glimmering white trumpets of a
tobacco-plant that grew behind the bench. The only form in which tobacco smells
anything but poisonous! And there were such beds of it at home ... in the
evening it scented all the grounds....

“Major Montresor, as he told you, knew me in my home, knew all my people,” I
went on slowly. “He knew all the places I went to before I had to drop out of
everything that I cared for and had to slave for my own living in that
detestable City of yours.”

“You speak as if _I_ owned the City—as if I were responsible for your having had
to work there—for the whole thing! Is that fair? Must you go on making me stand
for all that? Supposing it hadn’t been there at all that you first met me,
Nancy?”

For the first time the name slipped out from my official _fiancé_ quite
naturally. “Don’t you think,” he went on, “that we might have managed to get on
moderately well then?”

“How can I tell?” said I. I _wanted_ to keep him on that strictly business
footing. This other I didn’t want. I knew it would take something from me, and
give me nothing—nothing to stand up for myself with—in its place. “Try to
imagine,” he persisted, “that I’d known you in your home, like that
chap—what’s-his-name—”

The name—Vandeleur—flickered between us once more like that bat in the air!
—“like Montresor. Imagine that you’d never been at the Near Oriental—never heard
of the place. I’m sure I often wish _I_ hadn’t,” the Governor’s voice came
ruefully out of the dusk. “Then, instead of this eternal sparring—”

“My only refuge,” I thought, “and he’s trying to turn me out of it!”

—“there might surely have been something distinctly resembling friendship
between us?” he said. I said obstinately, “Might there? I don’t know.”

He moved. There wasn’t enough light to see his face. Only his collar made a
white blur against the branch, and the broad slope of his shoulders showed dark
against the sky that had deepened from lilac to purple. “But I know,” he said
quietly, “that you could—that you _could_ be——”

He paused. “Well?” I said, rather uncomfortably. “I could be what?”

“Rather a little brick to me if you chose,” said the Governor. I am sure it
slipped out without his meaning it to. _He_ would have been ready to go on
arguing quite logically about “how much more sensible” et cetera.... How there
was “absolutely no valid reason why it shouldn’t” and so forth ... for another
hour! _He_ can’t know how the key of a logical argument will fumble forever at
the locked safe-door of a woman’s mind that could just fly open to the cipher
spelt “Appreciation.”

—“Rather a little brick.”

So he did think me capable of that? I was glad of the dark under the copper-
beech. For I didn’t want my employer to see that his words had any sort of
effect on me. Four words ought not, certainly, to be enough to threaten to bring
one’s flag down with a run ... or even to flush one’s cheeks with that sudden
warmth—of surprise. I didn’t mean to hesitate——

But there was a moment’s silence before I could think what to say. I was glad he
was standing right away from me....

Just at that, he came and sat down beside me on the garden-seat. “Well?” he said
expectantly. “M-m—very well,” I heard myself say with a little sigh. “You mean
that you will?”—quickly. “That it’s peace between us?”

“Yes—” reluctantly, from me. “And that, instead of remaining”—I heard him laugh
a little—“a mere _fiancée_, you’ll be friends now—real chums?”

“If you like,” I sighed again. “That _is_ promotion, isn’t it?” I said, not
meaning to be altogether too polite to him. “Nancy, I know I’m rotten in lots of
ways,” he admitted frankly. “I daresay you think I’ve got a beast of a temper,
don’t you?”

“Well,” I said slowly, “you did kick Cariad, didn’t you?”

“Little brute needs it! He’s disgustingly spoilt. Everyone is who belongs to my
mother.” ...

“And you did make Theo cry!”

“Did her good!”

“It didn’t in the least! She was just as bad again to-day!”

“Was she, by Jove? Then I shall have to——”

“No, no, she wasn’t. I mean, _you_ are!”

“Ah, but I’m—_we’re_ going to turn over a new leaf!” he said, laughing. “That’s
settled, isn’t it? Good! This is going to be no end better, all round.”

All very well for _him_ to say so! I thought, as I got up and turned towards the
dim, blue-white front of the house with the dark girdle of the veranda circling
it, and the windows, now lighted up, set into it like a chain of long, rosy
jewels. He rose too. “Well!” he said, straightening himself a head and shoulders
above me. “Do we shake hands on that, Nancy?”

“I suppose so,” said I. What else was there to say or do? _I_ don’t consider
it’s going to be “better all round.” For me it will be ever so much more
awkward—as well as something—yes!—something like a _climb-down_. Still——

As he held out his hand I put my own into a particularly warm and hearty grip.
It was the very first time we’d shaken hands at all. Last night a kiss on the
hair! To-night, a handshake!... And, in spite of all I’d expected, he’d never
once mentioned that kiss. I suppose he won’t now. CHAPTER XX

FRIENDS

Often, when I’ve imagined something was going to be so easy and delightful, it’s
turned out to involve every kind of difficulty and unpleasantness. Like earning
my own living in the City. And then other things, which I’ve foreseen as such
odious and constant worries, have proved to be not nearly so bad after all; in
fact, quite amusing—that’s like agreeing to be “friends—real chums” with my
employer Mr. Waters. He’s really quite—I don’t know how to put it—_different_. I
know he’s trying to be “decent” to me, and yet not trying hard enough to make me
feel it’s my duty to “play up” and to be unnaturally sweet in return. Instead, I
am beginning to feel that I shall soon be able to like him genuinely, just as I
like Blanche and Theo, though perhaps not quite as well as I like his mother,
who seems more of a darling every day. This morning after I came back from
driving to the station with the Governor, she called me, and I went into the
little tiny room off the drawing-room, which is furnished only with one deep
chair and her writing-table, but of which each wall is simply covered with
framed photographs of her children at every stage. She was sitting at the
writing-table, with a pile of letters to answer. “Sit in the big chair, Nancy. I
won’t keep you more than a minute,” she said, turning to me, “but I wanted to
speak to you. It’s about our summer plans, dear.”

“Oh, yes,” I began. The fortnight which I’d arranged to spend at The Lawn—and
which seems about three months now!—is up to-morrow. I was just going to remind
her of this, when she said, “We all—not only Billy!—are so anxious that you
shall stay on, Nancy. You will, won’t you, if you haven’t made other
arrangements?”

“Oh! I’ve made none,” I said, hesitating both in my official and unofficial
capacities. I didn’t _mind_ staying on, now. Still—ought I to do it? “We have
only a week or so,” said Mrs. Waters, “before we go away to the sea. That is,
the girls and I are off on Saturday week to Anglesey.”

“To Porth Cariad?” I said. “Isn’t that the place—he told me about?”

“Yes; Billy’s so fond of it! It’s just a tiny place with a station and a post-
office and a handful of cottages. We take the two cottages nearest the sea, and
let just the woman and her daughter ‘do’ for us. He likes that so much better
than going to a ‘resort’ with hotels and esplanades and things.”

“Of course!”

Mrs. Waters gave me a pleased, girlish smile. “Then, if you do too, you’ll come,
won’t you? He didn’t seem sure whether”—she laughed a little—“whether it
mightn’t bore you rather; but he made me promise to ask you. Will you come?”

“I should like it very much,” I said sincerely, for, since this revised version
of my relations with Mr. Waters, there’s an end of any more complications for
the present. It has been worth while sinking the small satisfactions of being
“cattish” and making two-edged remarks to my employer. I seem, now, to have all
the advantages of being engaged to a quite friendly and easy-to-get-on-with
young man, without the horrible disadvantage of feeling it’s a permanency. Yes;
I do like having the freedom of a man’s conversation and society without
_arrière pensée_. And it seems to me that the only way to enjoy them is by being
officially—that is, _nominally_, engaged to the man! In any other sort of
acquaintanceship there looms the possibility of the “Real” engagement. All the
time that the girl and the man are having what might be a jolly and
unembarrassed conversation about really interesting things—not Love and
nonsense—that possibility is being conjugated between them by some horrid form
of Conscience or Self-consciousness. Something like this:

“_I might fall in love._”

“_Thou mightest fall in love._”

“_She might think I was falling in love._”

“_He might imagine I wanted him to fall in love._”

“_We might both fall in love._”

“_You might tease us about being in love._”

“_They might say we were actually engaged!_”

All this we—Mr. Waters and I—are spared. The feeling of it, which is there like
a brick wall between almost every unattached young man and young woman, I know;
I’ve felt it there between Sydney and myself, long, long before I knew he
admired me. And this same wall—well, it’s not so much that it’s never been
built, or even that it’s been pulled down, as that it’s not _between_ Mr. Waters
and me, just because we’re sitting on the top of it and talking all the more
comfortably for having climbed it together! Consequently, I really was pleased
to accept Mrs. Waters’ invitation. And when she said further, “Billy won’t be
able to join us for a fortnight, I’m afraid. Will you go back, dear, to this
friend of yours you live with in London, and come on later? Or—of course you
know we should love it!—could you come with Blanche and Theo and me?” I said,
“Do let me come with you and the girls.”

“That’s right,” said the Governor’s mother. “Then I shall write to Mrs. Roberts
at the cottages, and tell her to have the extra bedroom in _my_ cottage ready
for you.”

“And I will write to Cicely Harradine—that’s the girl I live with,” said I. “And
I ought to go up one day this week to the flat, and see her and collect a few
things.”

“Go up on Saturday, dear,” suggested the Governor’s mother. “Then Billy could
motor you up; he would like that so much.”

She has so many plans of this kind for me, fostered by this delusion that her
son is always on the look-out for a chance to be alone with me. Of course it’s
not quite the same kind of delusion now that it was a week ago. The Governor’s
“Good!” when he heard that I was going to spend the summer holidays with them at
that curiously-named place in Anglesey was quite as sincere in its way, I do
believe, as Theo’s “_Joy!_ Oh, it will be twice as lovely as usual with Nancy
there to show everything to!” He wasn’t the least bored, either, when Mrs.
Waters put forward the plan of his motoring me up to town. “Rather! A good
idea,” he said briskly. “What about starting earlier after lunch, and doing a
matinée this afternoon? You’ve never been to the theatre with me yet, Nancy,
and—we talked about that one day.”

“So we did,” said I demurely, remembering that grisly occasion at the Carlton.
“Well, would you care about it?”

“I should! Why! I haven’t been to the theatre for ages. I haven’t seen anything;
not even _Milestones_!”

“Care for that?”

“Anything, so long as it’s a play!”

“Then I’ll ’phone up now for seats.”

And as he spoke through the telephone that is fixed up in the den, I had almost
a start at what seemed to me the strangeness of my employer’s voice. Yet that
curt, metallic “_Hullo!_” used to be familiar enough to me—the only tone of his
voice, indeed, that I’d ever heard! *       *       *       *       *

Passing the long waiting queue at the gallery entrance to the Royalty this
afternoon, I glanced idly towards all those people who had stood for over an
hour, probably, to get a shilling seat; the playgoers to whom I myself belonged
a couple of months ago. Yet I never felt I’d belonged to them.... I suppose no
woman, from a factory-hand to a viscountess, feels that she really “belongs” to
any but the life of luxury. I don’t believe men feel that as strongly—and yet
it’s they who are supposed to be the more finished and civilized sex. I must ask
Mr. Waters, now that I know him well enough, what he thinks about this? I was
just wondering, when, out of that mosaic of black and coloured pattern formed by
the crowd, there turned with one movement three dabs of colour, three cheap,
effective little hats; and three girlish faces, alight with amusement and
recognition, were lifted towards us. They nodded and smiled; and I, leaning
forward out of the car, was just in time to wave my hand to them. “Friends of
yours?” said my employer, glancing back as he raised his hat! “Why, yes! Didn’t
you know them?”

“No! Why should I?”

“Because you see them every day,” I laughed. “They were Miss Robinson, Miss Holt
and Miss Smith from your office.”

“No? By Jove,” said Mr. Waters, rather blankly. Which surprised me rather, as I
remembered his care that “the other typists should know for a fact” with whom I
was going out, that first time of all. I was conscious, though I couldn’t see
where they sat in the gallery, that their three pairs of eyes must be glued to
us in our front-row stalls. Nothing could have been more conventional than our
appearance—we were absolutely the model of a prosperous young engaged couple up
from the suburbs; I, prettily dressed, with the inevitable box of chocolates on
my lap; he, good tempered and easy of manner, paying me all the customary
attentions of programme, helping me off with my coat, seeing that I had opera-
glasses, the best seat, and so on, and yet—apart from the “official engagement”
side of it, how _really_ unconventional was our relation! So much more
satisfactory under the circumstances than a real engagement! Or that pie-bald
thing, an understanding! Or that other form of platonic friendship which either
the girl or the man is always hoping, or fearing, may turn into something else!
The curtain went up to the soft strains of a tune which I, who have had to play
accompaniments to so many songs, didn’t know.... But beside us and behind us
there were old ladies who murmured, “Ah! ‘_She wore a Wreath of Roses._’”

The play began, and I forgot everything else for a time. In the first interval
we amused ourselves by looking at the audience. They were nearly _all_ elderly
ladies! As the Governor remarked, “Nancy! Yours and mine are the only heads for
three rows of seats that aren’t grey-haired or covered with bonnets!”

“They’ve come to catch echoes of their past,” I murmured flippantly as those
tunes from the _Mikado_ sent the curtain up on Act II. That finished my
flippancy for me. In what seemed like hours afterwards I heard Mr. Waters’
voice, cool and detached, saying something about good acting and soothing syrup
and the most sentimental public in the world, then breaking off suddenly,
anxiously to exclaim, “What is it, Nancy? Aren’t you well?”

“Of c-course I am! I’m only enjoying myself!” I sobbed quietly; tears dripping
down on to the pleated frill of my afternoon blouse. “I think it’s p-perfectly
lovely!” And I dabbed my face with the powder-puff swathed in my handkerchief.
“Rum idea of enjoyment,” said the Governor doubtfully. “Not a bit rum,” I
argued, having steadied myself again. “You don’t know much about girls—they’re
mostly like that—ask any of them—ask any of the other typists in your office!”

“I suppose I’ve never looked upon those as ‘girls,’” said he. “They’re—machines!
machines that eat cherries all day long and chuck the stones all over the floor.
Such inefficient ones, too; they——Why d’you laugh, Nancy! I say, you know quite
well I don’t mean——”

“Ssh!” came indignantly from under the bonnet—trimmed with squashed heliotropes
and doddering jet beads—on the other side of him, as the band struck up the
rollicking two-step that heralds the twentieth-century act. I didn’t cry any
more, though. I believe I was actually less taken up with what was on the stage
than with the oddness of my having been behind two sets of scenes myself; with
those girls who “couldn’t possibly look upon Still Waters as ‘a man,’ exactly”
and then with this man who never really considered typists as “girls.” When had
he left off considering me as just a typist? How soon before that evening when
we became friends? Once more I felt grateful to that evening’s compact, as I
followed the tall figure with that slight dip from the broad shoulders in to the
waist—that line so painfully cultivated by Major Montresor!—and let it make a
path for me out of the theatre and to the waiting car. I believe I’ve always
really hated going about London alone, or with just another girl! *       *
*       *       *

“Now, then! Rumpelmayer’s, or the Piccadilly, or where, for tea, Nancy, before I
take you on to your friend’s?”

“I meant to have tea with her,” I explained. “I was going on in the bus, and
getting down to Sevenoaks afterwards by the dinner-train; saying good-bye to you
here.”

“Oh, were you! Why not take me along too?” he suggested, looking down at me.
Well! Why shouldn’t he realize in what sort of places these machines called
working-girls live? He’d heard about the lawns and gardens, and so forth, of my
old home. Let him see the change I’d had before—well, before that first
interview in his office. Then there was Cicely. Yes, when I left her she was
still rather “difficult” about my engagement—rather given to unspoken hopes that
I wasn’t doing it for the money. Let her see that my (official) _fiancé_ was
quite a human sort of young man—the sort that some girls really might get
engaged to without a thought of his income! “My chum is a very pretty girl,”
said I; “_she’s_ worth looking at——”

“Fair?”

“No, glorious red hair.”

“Well, take me along and let me look at it!” he urged boyishly; and presently we
were speeding along down the Embankment towards Marconi Mansions. I had my
latch-key in my vanity-bag. I opened the door at the top of the many stone steps
and led the way into the passage, which seemed about as light and wide as a
good-sized drainpipe after that airy, tiled vestibule at The Lawn. Meaning to
take Cicely by surprise, I quietly walked into our small front sitting-room. But
it was Cicely who took me by surprise. She had, already, a visitor for tea.
Thick cigarette-smoke made a blue haze above the jumble of odd bits of furniture
which we’d picked up second-hand in the Old King’s Road, above the tea-table
with its Persian Rose pottery, its plate of Chelsea buns and its green dish of
cherries—I hoped there weren’t many stones on the floor!—a haze that half
obscured Cicely’s bright head and the figure that reclined, opposite to her, in
our comfiest basket-chair. I saw by the unusual garments of it that it must
be—yes! Sydney Vandeleur! Really, I don’t know which of the four of us was least
pleased to see the others, while I introduced Mr. Waters to Cicely and said
gaily to the men, “I think you’ve met before” ... and forced myself to dissipate
the odious pause that followed the insincerely civil greetings by plunging into
some sort of conversation. It was worst for me, I think. I was so utterly taken
aback—first, by finding Sydney there at all, and then by wondering what on earth
the Governor would think of his being there—_and in those clothes_! For Sydney’s
latest idea for not being slavishly got-up like every other miserably
conventional tailor’s dummy was, apparently, to have his “things” more or less a
copy, but an _édition de luxe_, of a French fisher-boy’s _vareuse_-blouse and
skirt-like trousers; those brown corduroys were of corduroy-velvet at goodness
knows what a yard, cut by some master-hand in Savile Row; the very bagginess at
the ankles, above the leaf-brown silk socks, had been carefully studied. And the
Governor!—who’d once said:

“_After all, what’s unusual in dress is wrong, nine times out of ten. Eight
times, it’s also hideous._”

He must be positively flabbergasted at this spectacle! I’m more accustomed to
those ideas; but even I found it a relief to turn my eyes upon his stereotyped
grey suit after that fell and deadly “_effectiveness_” of Sydney’s.... Posing in
his dress like that! Posing, even more shamelessly, in his manner! For wouldn’t
you have thought that anyone who’d been refused by a girl and who then came
unexpectedly face to face with that girl and the person for whom he imagines
she’s jilted him—_wouldn’t_ you suppose that he would at least behave like a
man? Take it without flinching, even if it were fairly unpleasant, and carry it
off as if nothing particular had happened? _I_ shall never think the same of
Sydney again for not doing that. Perhaps it served me right for the rather
spiteful note I wrote to him just before I went off to The Lawn, but—Need he
have committed the solecism of calling me, when I’ve never been anything but
“Monica” to him, “_Miss Trant_” in italics? It was trying! So was the pathetic
look which he saw fit to call up into his spanielly brown eyes as he glanced
from me to Mr. Waters. (Mask well down there, so I couldn’t guess what _he_ made
of this velvet-and-Vandyke apparition.) And the worm-in-the-bud expression which
Sydney let steal over the whole of his dreamy, Cavalier’s face as he turned it,
in a way that all but said “Ah! You understand what I suffer!” to Cicely——

Cicely, too! _Cicely_, who’s shared ups and downs with me for the last two
years! Even she must needs forsake me, making matters worse by creating a
general atmosphere of blight even while she was bringing in two more leadless-
glaze cups and plates, and making fresh tea, and by giving an accurate though
unspoken impression of what she “understood.”

“Yes! I am the looker-on at this game. I see it all! The sensitive, artistic
soul—”

(This is what she thinks of Sydney.) —“torn by the sight of this hopelessly
stodgy, commonplace young man—”

(I know that this is how she sums up my friend Mr. Waters.) —“being preferred to
himself! Ah, Love is blind!”

(Meaning me.) “And people never seem to recognize the right man until it’s too
late.”

(Deluded little donkey!) We had tea. What a meal! “You do take sugar in it,
don’t you, Tots?” plaintively from Cicely, with a side-effect of, “She’s so
deplorably altered in everything else, I don’t know what any of her tastes may
be now!”

“Does Mr. Waters take it?” (To _me_!) “Not any, thanks,” from the Governor.
“Only milk.”

Cicely’s glance commented silently, “Ah! Incompatibility latent here! An unhappy
marriage!”

Why, why hadn’t I said I’d like to go to Rumpelmayer’s, or Lyons’—or Lockhart’s?
Anything rather than this funereal feast, with Sydney Vandeleur as the skeleton
thereat! Even if he’d remained a voiceless skeleton! But, cheered by all the
subtle encouragement and moral support from his pretty hostess—I must say Cicely
was looking prettier than ever!—Sydney began to recover a little, relaxed his
first pose of open broken-heartedness, and proceeded to _talk_. Nobody else did.
Mr. Waters looked as if nothing was going to force his lips asunder again. I
didn’t want to say anything. Cicely was quite happy to listen. And Sydney held
forth. He began with—“Have you been to—” and “Haven’t you seen—” various
picture-galleries and pieces of an “advanced” type. “What! Not seen ‘_The
Keening of Deidre_,’ even? But why not?” he protested to me, lolling back in
that chair as if he didn’t possess a spine. “Oh, it’s such a wonderful thing; so
subtle and so brutal at the same time. And one’s sure of seeing everyone one
wants to see, in the pit; a positive At Home of them. Better than the dear old
palmy days of the Sicilians. I have been three times. The whole effect is so—so
sculptured! You would love it! Oh, you must take her”—this to my official
_fiancé_, who sat silent and non-committal and very bolt-upright. “You really
must not miss it. It is coming off next week.”

“I’m going away next week,” said I. “Oh, yes? To the country?”

“To Wales.”

“Ah, Wales! It used to be so wild and charming and remote—almost as good as
those perfectly untrodden tracts we still get in the West of Ireland. But it’s
frightfully overdone now,” complained Sydney. “One doesn’t know if it’s the
fault of Lloyd George, or the picture postcards, or that appalling little
railway up Snowdon, but Wales has become so _obvious_. When I’m going over to
Ballycool, do you know, I have to read all the way in the train between Chester
and Holyhead, in terror lest I should inadvertently catch sight of any of the
‘scenery.’ I assure you”—to Cicely—“that when you get that Snowdon Range, cut
out in purple cardboard jig-saws against what the dear tourists call ‘a glorious
sunset’ it’s almost exactly like a landscape in the Academy!”

“How _perfectly_ dreadful!” sympathized Cicely—little humbug! who, only last
year, used to mark her favourite pictures in the Academy Catalogue. I do hate a
girl’s tastes to be mere echoes of the man she’s with! “And those ruined
castles; they’re really almost too priceless to be true,” enlarged Sydney.
“Turrets like this”—he zig-zagged with a finger in the air, while a gold curb
bracelet chinked at his slim wrist—“reflected, wherever possible, in water.
Terrible! I mean, you simply _have_ to laugh! You feel the landscape
transforming itself into wings and a drop-scene before your eyes! And the
‘Elephant Mountain’ that they insist on pointing out to you, because it really
_is_ so like an elephant’s back! (Such an attraction!). And then those _meaty_
pink clouds that they always contrive to get so symmetrically posed _just_
behind the summit of Snowdon! Snowdon itself is so hopelessly banal that it only
just falls short of perfection. Excruciating! Cader Idris, now, is a little
better,” he went on kindly. “It is still possible to introduce Cader to one’s
friends. Cader, with that quaint lake they have there, remains quite an
attractive mountain, I think”—turning to Mr. Waters, who still looked as if _he_
couldn’t think of anything to say to this person who patted the Welsh mountains,
so to speak, on the head. “We aren’t going to be among the mountains,” he
announced briefly. “My people generally settle for six weeks or so in Anglesey.”

“Not really? How amusing—I mean, it’s really possible to ‘settle’ there?” said
Sydney Vandeleur, lifting his dark Vandyke beard from his tie—heavens, what a
tie! I’d only just noticed that. “One had always looked upon Anglesey as a sort
of straight line leading to the North Wall.”

“H’m,” said the Governor, who, having checked a “Can-such-things-be?” start, was
obviously trying to keep his eyes off that tie of Sydney’s: a bunch of amber
silk, patterned with blatant little splashes of scarlet, black, magenta,
emerald-green.... Futurist, I presume. How could I ever, ever have dreamt that
life, even in Ballycool Castle, could have been tolerable with a man who wore
ties like that? I should have left him in a week. No! I’m sure I should never
have been there to leave him. I couldn’t....

Sydney lighted another cigarette, and the conversation languished. _Nobody_
spoke. In the middle of this sickening sag to the talk I had an inspiration! I
thought, since both these young men sing and one of them composes, that it would
be at this juncture a bright thought to introduce the subject of music. Why did
I do it? It was distinctly what Jack calls “a wash-out.” For Sydney Vandeleur at
once switched off on to Eleventh Century folk-songs. And Mr. Waters, asked if he
didn’t think they were too delicious, was “afraid the Eleventh Century was out
of his groove.”

And then Sydney hummed several only slightly more modern Celtic dirges—one about
“The Sweet Flowers, all gone to Decay!”

And Mr. Waters said he preferred his flowers _fresh_; adding bluntly that he
loathed all those miserable minor wails himself, and quite agreed with that law
which Queen Elizabeth passed for the Irish bards of her time, sentencing them to
death if they composed songs on any subject whatsoever except in praise of the
Queen’s most Excellent Majesty. That brought back some of Sydney’s first pose.
With a pained little smile he turned to me, then, putting on just the expression
of the bereaved collie in Landseer’s “Shepherd’s Chief Mourner,” he asked me if
I _happened_ to have kept the MS. of that little thing he’d written for me to
that sonnet—“_Kissing her Hair, I sat against her Feet_.”

I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my own wretched hair that he’d always
so praised ... there was something about kissing of hair which _he_ knew nothing
of, and that I was only too thankful to let die a natural death.... Rather
shortly, I answered, “Oh, that song—yes; it’s tucked away in some drawer or
other here, I believe.”

“If it wouldn’t be troubling you too much, Miss Trant, to lend it to me again?
It was my only copy,” suggested Sydney softly (_con molto espressione_). “Of
course,” said I. “I’ll find it for you now. Cicely, you might come into my room
and help me to hunt.”

Cicely followed me, leaving those two men to entertain each other. How they
proceeded to do so I suppose I shall never know! “Well, Cis, how are you getting
on?” I asked her, when the door was closed between us and them. “Foot’s all
right, I see, and you said you’d gone back to work?”

“Yes, but not at Chérisette’s, you know; I’m working opposite in Bond Street;
Madame Lamaire’s. Mr. Vandeleur got me an introduction from his married sister,
who knows her; and I’m getting a better salary, and such a much better time,
there. He has been so awfully kind, Tots!”

“Has he? Have you—been seeing a good deal of him, then?”

“He’s been here several times, but”—reproachfully—“only to talk about you!”

“Good of him,” I said. Cicely looked more reproach. “Well, he says you’ve taken
all the colour out of his life and left ‘_gold tarnished and the grey above the
green_.’”

“Drat him! And his colours!” I quoted Mrs. Skinner vulgarly and vindictively.
“He’d plenty of them left in his tie, anyhow.”

“I am afraid,” said Cecily aloofly and with a pointed comparison in her face,
“that you’ve scarcely _realized_ Mr. Vandeleur.”

“Haven’t I? Well, the sort of man who, when he’s turned down by one girl, must
needs rush and pour it all out into the shell-like ear of the next——” But I
broke off here. What I suddenly did realize was that, for next to no reason, I
was on the brink of squabbling ridiculously with my chum. So I hastily changed
the subject to rent-money and the length of time I should probably be away,
caught up Sydney’s ever-to-be-hated song, reassured Cicely that I was not going
to be married until after the summer—_long_ after! and told her I was glad she
was getting on so well. “Get Mr. Vandeleur, if he wants cheering up, to take you
to ‘_The Keening of Deidre_,’” said I. “Good-bye!”

*       *       *       *       *

It threatened to be a silent motor-drive back to Sevenoaks. Again I felt that I
should have to be the one to take the plunge into conversation. “Well?” I said.
“Didn’t you think Miss Harradine a very pretty girl?”

“Beautiful hair,” said Mr. Waters, “hasn’t she?”

“Oh, lovely.”

Silence. I saw that Mr. Waters hadn’t realized what I suspected: namely, that
Sydney was beginning to find my chum quite sufficiently “lovely” as a girl, not
merely as a confidante for his sorrows about “another,” who was, as he imagined,
“another’s.” But I was longing to hear some comment on Sydney. I should have
been left longing, I suppose, if I hadn’t said straight out, “What _did_ you
think of Mr. Vandeleur?”

“Oh, come! What a question! How can one tell, after seeing a man for half an
hour? He seemed—clever, and all that,” fenced my companion. “Of course he’s not
the sort of man _I_ get thrown much with in that sordid, detestable City of
mine, as you call it. What does he do?”

“He doesn’t have to ‘do’ anything.”

“Rather lucky for him,” remarked Mr. Waters, in a tone I didn’t fathom. I said,
“But he does draw and design—and he writes dramatic criticisms—and he composes.”

“Gifted sort of chap,” said Mr. Waters smoothly. “I suppose——”

And then stopped. “You suppose what?” I urged. “No, do tell me,” as he looked
obstinately ahead and shut his lips into that line. “You _must_, Billy!” Then I
found myself laughing and colouring a little with surprise. For the first time
I’d used that absurd name in speaking directly to him. He turned to me, smiling
once more in quite a friendly way. But it was not to answer my question. It was
to ask another. “Nancy, you know I shall expect you to write to me? When you’re
at Porth Cariad with my mother and the girls, I mean.... It’ll look funny if you
don’t.”

“Oh, of course. For the look of the thing,” said I, “I’ll write.”

“Sorry to trouble you. You can put a blank sheet into the envelope, you know, if
you like.”

“I hadn’t thought of that!” I laughed, glad to be once again on comfortable
terms of chatty friendship. “But—so I can.”

“Well, as long as you don’t forget to send _something_,” said Billy Waters. *
*       *       *       *

He reminded me of this once again, on Euston platform. For we—his mother, his
sisters, his official _fiancée_ and the little dog—left London at eleven o’clock
on the following Saturday morning. That evening we were all among the sand-
slopes and the gorse and the soft calling of the waves at Porth Cariad. CHAPTER
XXI

THE FIRST LETTERS

“Hullo, Robert Roberts! Any letters for us?” sang out Theo. She had darted out
of the cottage, hatless, as usual, her nose already peeling with sunburn and her
long bare legs covered with midge-bites and sea-holly scratches down to her
white sand-shoes, to waylay our postman; he’s the son of Mrs. Roberts, our
landlady, a young Welsh giant who wears that uniform coat for just that five
minutes daily which it takes him to deliver the mails at Porth Cariad. “Yes,
mam!” he announced. “Picture poss-card for you—I wonder shall I have it, mam,
when you read it? Blodwen and me is making a co-leckshon of those. Letter for
your mother; letter an’ _big_ parsal for the strange young lady.”

I—who have not been seen in the place before this year—am the strange young
lady. “Here you are,” said Theo, bringing the mail into the kitchen-sitting-room
where we’d just finished breakfast; a room that boasts three grandfather clocks
and five pairs of china dogs and a dresser crowded with blue-and-white plates.
“The letter and the ‘parsal’ for Nancy are both from the Adored One!”

Meaning her brother. “And I suppose you’ll now have to fly off somewhere to read
your love-letter all by yourself.”

“Of course I must,” I laughed. For it’s rather amusing in the face of all this
to think that, except for one sentimental scrap from Sydney, I’ve never had a
love-letter to read in all my life! *       *       *       *       *

This duty-document of my official _fiancé’s_ I’ve taken out on to the sand-
hills; there’s a dip under the crest of one of them where I can curl up in
comfort out of the wind, facing the view across the bay, with that pale lilac
silhouette of the Carnarvonshire hills across the water. How funny it seems to
unfold a letter bearing the familiar heading of the Near Oriental Shipping
Company’s offices! But this one, actually, is not type-written, and signed by a
“William Waters, per pro.,” and a scrawled “A. A.” of Mr. Alexander’s. William
Waters has written in his own hand; not a particularly good one, either. Several
sheets of it? Was it such an unusually slack day at the office, then? “July —,
1913. “MY DEAR NANCY,

“I was glad to hear _from my mother_”

(I don’t see why he should underline the three last words; _I_ shouldn’t be
likely to write first.) “that you’d arrived safely and were comfortably settled
into     the cottages. I wonder what you think of Porth Cariad. I do     hope
you won’t be bored to extinction in such a quiet spot;     but you were warned,
weren’t you, not to expect esplanades and     pier-concerts and shops and
things? Do you think you can manage     to make yourself at all happy without
them? “How do you like the bathing in that little bay next to the     cottages?
Can you swim? If not, you will have to learn. I will     teach you. “I am pretty
keen on getting down myself, I can tell you. Town,     in this heat, is the
abomination of desolation; and smelly. So     is the office. You’ve never been
here in July. It’s awful. I’ll     let you know later when I shall be coming;
time of train, etc. “You were missed at The Lawn last night. I took a man who
lives     near to share my solitary meal there, and to have a game of
billiards afterwards. He wanted me to try over ‘Ford of Kabul     River’ for
him; I can’t accompany myself, though, and he made     an awful hash of it. I
wished we’d dined in town and gone to a     show. “When I go out to lunch I
shall call at Fuller’s and order them     to send you on—for the look of the
thing—a box of chocolates. I hope they have one with a picture of forget-me-nots
or     something of the sort on the lid,”

(Yes; they had. White satin, with the sprays of flowers embroidered in pale blue
silk.) “as Theo notices everything. Don’t let her bag all the sweets,
though.”

(Here the writing gets more scrawly and hurried.) “Have just got in from lunch,
which I had with my uncle. He was     full of talk; you can imagine it!”

(I can.) “I also saw two other men whom I’d got to meet, and as a result     of
this, I think I’ve managed to get through the business that     was keeping me.
So I shall be down at the end of the week after     all; cheers for some fresh
air and a dip! Please be very glad     to see me, will you? as Theo—but I put
that before. “Just before I went out to lunch a very rum thing happened:     at
least, I thought it was rum until I found out what it     was. I was opening the
door of my room when I heard, in the     passage, _your voice_, Nancy! Yes, your
voice, with that     little dare-devil tone you put on sometimes, saying these
extraordinary words: ‘_I think it’s to the Savoy that I’m going     out with Mr.
Waters to-day_!’

“I couldn’t think what on earth was the meaning of it, with you     miles away
in Anglesey.”

(But already I smiled, seeing what was coming!) “I wondered what could have
brought you back, or if I’d got an     hallucination—can you hear
hallucinations?—and I bolted out     into the passage, nearly knocking over two
of the typists who     were coming down it. “Miss Smith (that’s the one whose
affections are otherwise     engaged, isn’t it?) fled like a hare; but that
tall, dark Miss     Robinson stood her ground, only moving aside a little for me
to pass. I stopped and asked her straight out, ‘Was it you who     were speaking
a moment ago?’

“She said ‘Yes’—all meekness at once. ‘Mimicking hussy’ I     thought—for it
really had been exactly the way I’ve heard you     speak, you know, sometimes.
It was all I could do to keep from     laughing outright, but I just said ‘Well,
I am writing to Miss     Trant to-day; can I give her any message from you?’

“And she said (in that ‘mim’ voice, which I’m blest if I shall     ever feel
able to believe in again!) ‘Will you please give her     my love, Mr. Waters?’

“So with love from Miss Robinson, I remain,

“Your

“BILLY.”

(What’s this? “Your” Billy? It can’t be. Oh, no. It’s his disgraceful
handwriting. It’s the “r” being scrawled into the “s” like that. “Yours, Billy,”
is how it really reads. How stupid of me not to see that at once! Then there’s a
bit across the top.) “Six-forty train Porth Cariad on Saturday. You might write
and     tell me how you do like the place; and you might answer at     once,
even if it’s only for the girls to take it to the post.”

So, for the benefit of Blanche and Theo, I will write at once; I’ll do it out
here, in pencil on my pad, as I’ve so often taken down his own letters. (One of
these days I shall tell him how I loathed it, and how utterly impossible his
dictation was!) “Porth Cariad. July —, 1913. “DEAR SIR,

“Your favour of yesterday’s date to hand, for which we thank     you.”

(There! I wonder how he’ll like that. Will he think that it goes on all
through?) “The lovely sweets really were appreciated; but I didn’t let     Theo
bag them all, nor take the pale-blue satin tie-up to make     a bow for Cariad,
which was what she wanted to do. So then she     said of course Nancy would want
to keep that ribbon to tie     round all your letters. She does notice
everything, doesn’t she? “As for how I like this place, I simply love it, and
the     cottages—I’m in the bigger one with your mother, and Theo and
Blanche are together in the other until you come—and I love the     sand-hills
with the sea-holly and little prickly brambly roses     and tiny purple pansies
growing all over them,”

(I might slip a pansy from this place that he’s fond of into the envelope? No, I
mightn’t. There’s no Theo to “notice” at his end.) “and the cloud shadows on
those hills opposite, and Mrs.     Roberts, with her sackcloth cooking-apron and
her clogs and the     boy’s cap she wears; and Blodwen, even if all the English
they     know does always seem to be all about you! And I should hate a
pier-concert if there was one. There’s everything here to make     me quite
happy. Since this very hot weather’s come, the bathing     is delicious. I
learned to swim when I was a little girl, thank     you.”

(So he needn’t think he can teach me anything.) “How was Mr. Albert Waters?
Still chuckling and laughing ‘ho,     ho!’ I expect. “_I_ laughed at your being
taken in like that by Miss Robinson. Yesterday morning I was almost taken in, by
something that was     like you: a sharp tap against my bedroom window that
might have     been a stone thrown up. But it was only a fat, speckly thrush
cracking a snail; there are always lots of them crawling out of     that
southernwood bush by the door. “Mrs. Roberts asks me to tell you,”

(What she _said_, in her speciously honeyed Welsh voice and with her
irresistible if toothless smile, was, “Tell your _Cariad_——” But I needn’t put
that.) “that the ’ooden ’ooman—it took me some time to remember that     this
was the figure-head on the cliff!—was want paint very bad,     and she wonder
would you do it when you come. Welsh people, I     notice, are fond of
‘wondering’ like this, instead of asking     straight out for what they want;
yet they generally seem to get     it.”

(Dear me, this is rather different from the blank sheet I might have
enclosed.... Anyhow, it mustn’t get any longer than his, so I’d better stop
now.) “I will give this to Theo to post, and”

(Goodness, it is difficult to think of how to sign oneself to young men. To
Sydney I was always “Yours sincerely.” A stupid ending, means nothing at all.)
“With kind regards.”

(No.) “Assuring you always of my best attention,”

(No. A bit of that at the beginning was enough.) “Will give this to Theo to
post, and I am,”

(Well! What I _am_, after all!) “Your official _fiancée_,

“MONICA TRANT.”

Ah! _Now_ there’s something I’d forgotten! “P. S. I will remember what you’ve
ordered—”

(No, that sounds rather nasty; rather too like Manner B. Cross it out.) —“what
you—wish”? No! “What you suggest about my being pleased     to see you on
Saturday. “N.”

As a matter of fact—I shan’t write it, as it might possibly give a wrong
impression!—but I really _shall_ be quite pleased to see Billy Waters again. And
now to find his young sister, and send her off to the post with what she, in her
innocence, imagines to be a return _love_-letter! CHAPTER XXII

THE WOODEN WOMAN

If a girl were the least bit inclined to fall in love with Billy Waters—and I
see now that some girls might be; though not, of course, any girl of my type,
capable of this kind of frank friendship that puts anything else out of the
question!—well, if she were, she’d find it much easier to complete the process
here at Porth Cariad than anywhere else that I can imagine him. Some
men—generally the nicest—are so much more _themselves_ in the depths of the
country. He is. I noticed that the very first evening he arrived here, when I
went down to meet him—to keep up appearances before his family—at this tiny
station on the branch line. Before the train stopped I saw his head and
shoulders blocking up the open window of his compartment in his hurry to arrive.
Catching sight of me on the platform, he took the pipe from between his strong
white teeth and flourished it over his head in greeting—his face one broad smile
because his holiday had begun; then the train slowed down; he was out of the
carriage door and taking a running stride towards me. “Hullo, Nancy!” he said,
and grasped my hands. “You came? I wondered if you would. It’s very—appropriate
of you. How are you? You look very fit. A sun-bonnet, eh?”—It was a haymaker’s
cotton one, that I’d bought for a shilling and a ha’penny at the post office,
and rather becoming—“I’ve never seen you in a pink sun-bonnet before.”

“You wouldn’t be likely to in Leadenhall Street,” I retorted. “How’s the dear
office?”

“I don’t know or care. I’m here to forget it,” he said gaily as we left the
station for the road between the sand-hills. “I think I shall take to wearing a
sun-bonnet myself!”

*       *       *       *       *

But what he wears here is just a soft white shirt with a turn-down collar and a
pair of loose grey flannel bags belted at the waist; no hat at all—his hair has
got to look as if it must be permanently rumpled; no one from the office would
recognize him! Even his eyes seem a different colour; so much warmer and bluer
for the deepening of his tan. He drops a year a day from his age, too. When one
sees him striding about these sandy lanes, or terrifying his mother by those
efforts to walk on his hands in six foot of water in the bay, or when he’s
pretending to jabber back Welsh to Mrs. Roberts and Blodwen, who openly adore
him—yes, I can imagine quite a number of people finding him positively
attractive here in the country. In the country, too, as I’ve always heard, it’s
so much easier to fall in love than it is in town. Town, with its rush and
racket and roar, seems to insist that the things that really matter are getting
on and making money—or even the bare living for which half these grimy crowds
are struggling and toiling! But the country!—_that_ has a way of suggesting
itself as a series of lovely backgrounds for a grouping of Two, and of coaxing
home the idea that all that matters is Love. To a falling-in-love kind of person
the country here would seem as bad as Hamlet for being “_so full of quotations_”
from every poet who ever wrote about trysts, and gathering rosebuds, and loves
in valleys, and foolish, pretty nonsense of that sort. _They’d_ be reminded of
it by every dance of a pair of blue butterflies over the dunes; every spread of
the rosy arms of sea-anemones in the pool towards the incoming wave; and as for
these other waves of scented gold that are poured over all the waste ground
hereabouts——

“It’s a blessing there’s such a lot of it out just now!” as Theo remarked this
morning at breakfast. “I suppose engaged people _would_ want to be where there
was plenty of gorse!”

Whereat her brother and I exchanged glances, across the table, of amused
intelligence. For it’s all very well for this child to think she can “chip” us
with that old tag about kissing and the gorse in bloom. We’ve only got to
remember how little she suspects that the only kiss between us is that “duty
good night” one of Uncle Albert’s visit, and the laugh is all on our side! *
*       *       *       *

“You needn’t laugh, Billy,” Theo added. “You know you’re really frightfully
cross because you won’t be able to get Nancy all to yourself this afternoon,
with these people coming!”

It was the first I’d heard of any visitors, for I’d come down rather late that
morning. I hadn’t slept as well as I usually do. Outside the window of my little
sloping-ceilinged cottage bedroom the water, at high tide, had seemed to make
rather more noise than its usual soft lap-lapping against the rocks. And then
the moon, rising like a big round primrose-coloured Chinese lantern in the star-
sprinkled purple sky over the Rivals on the other side of the Menai Straits, had
poured a flood of white radiance straight upon my bed, and I hadn’t bothered to
get up and pull down the yellow linen blind to shut it out. I had wanted to feel
the sea-scented night-breeze across my face. So I had lain there, tossing a
little between the snowy rough country sheets, watching the square of light
creeping inch by inch up the wall, and thinking idly of all sorts of irrelevant
things....

Of Cicely in Marconi Mansions....

Of “Smithie” at the office, and her boy. They didn’t prove much truth in the
theory that people fall more deeply in love in the country. I saw again that
crossing at the Bank, with the big motor-buses skidding across the muddy road
like beginners on skates; and there, in the middle of the fog and the petrol-
reek and the jostling luncheon-hour crowds, those two anæmic, City-fied young
faces shone as radiantly as if the lovers walked the loneliest Eden that ever
was....

Of a school-friend of my own, now very happily married, who had said to me, long
ago: “An engagement, Monica, is such a _skimpy_ time! It’s made up of nothing
but good-byes and good nights to the person you most want to be always with!”

And of the difference between that sort of engagement and the “arrangement”
between myself and Billy Waters, which has converted itself into such an
entirely satisfactory and amusing friendship.... The result was that I’d dropped
off to sleep again after Blodwen’s bang on my bedroom door, and that I’d been
the last down at breakfast. “Who’s this that’s coming, Billy?” I asked. “Your
Uncle Albert again?”

“No, thank—I mean, no, not him,” said Billy. “Some French people you haven’t met
yet. They’re touring North Wales in their car. He’s a man I’ve had a good deal
to do with in business.”

“And _she_——” began Theo, stopping uncharacteristically short as her brother
went on, tapping a letter he held. “I’ve just heard from him that they’re in
Holyhead now, and coming over here to look us up this afternoon. So that puts a
stopper on our plan of painting that figure-head for Mrs. Roberts after lunch.
We’ll have to see if we can get it done this morning instead. Good thing I got
that paint last night at the wheelwright’s. Are you on, Nancy? Then, if you’re
ready, we’ll start now, shall we?”

“Blanche and I don’t think we’ll come, thank you,” said Theodora punctiliously.
“What, not until you’re asked?” laughed her brother, rummaging for the paint-
pots under the southernwood bush at the cottage door. He gave me one pot and the
brushes to carry, taking the other two himself. “Well, good-bye, all!”

“Come back, then, Cariad!” called Blanche, but the little white dog frisked
unheedingly in circles ahead of us, across the shingle at the edge of the cove,
over a couple of sand-hills, then up the steps cut in the turf of the cliff
where the Roberts have set up a flagstaff and the wooden woman. *       *
*       *       *

She’d been the figure-head of the _Gwladys Pritchard_, Mrs. Roberts had told us,
which had been wrecked in the bay below, many years ago; the name and the face
alike having been copied from the real girl who was “cariad” to the owner of the
vessel. “She must have been pretty,” I thought, the first time I climbed the
cliff. For many coats of paint, roughly applied, could not spoil or disguise the
setting of the carved girl’s eyes, nor the tender oval of the up-tilted chin,
nor the lines of the neck flowing down into the sloping shoulders and the figure
held up in an unmodern curve above the corset of the Sixties, which must have
set the fashion of Miss Pritchard’s dress. She wore a little jacket with basques
and epaulettes and shoulder-seams set far down the sleeves; and a tiny pork-pie
hat, trimmed with a wing, was perched upon her hair, which had been last painted
yellow as the gorse that grew in hummocks all around her. The jacket had been
white, with trimmings of emerald green; the same green, too, plastered the hat
and the wooden nosegay which she held up against her breast. Yet, for all this
crude green-and-white, for all the untaught modelling of it, there was a
vitality about this graven image which I’d never seen in any statue. Was it
because it had once been part of that live thing, a ship? I could picture that
image of a slender girl, leaning breast forward again from the prow of her
lover’s vessel as she heaved and dipped like a gull on the waves; scanning
horizons, joyously riding the gale, and free to sea and sky! Rooted in turf, the
immobility of cliff and rock was now her prison, while the gulls still screamed
and wheeled above her....

And the real Gwladys? “Did she go down with the ship?” I’d asked Mrs. Roberts.
“No, indeed, mam. There wasn’t one drowned on the _Gwladys Pritchard_,” Mrs.
Roberts had assured us. “That Miss Pritchard she was marry to my cousin, Captain
Lloyd, since—dear me, I don’t know when. They keepin’ a public-house in
Bluemaris now. Ô! she _is_ gone stout, too!”

“It would have been _prettier_ if she’d been drowned,” Blanche had said softly.
“Mam?” Mrs. Roberts had said. But Mrs. Waters had finished the story by telling
us gently, “Anyhow, the Lloyds have three of the _sweetest_ little
grandchildren; I’ve seen them!”

Evidently _she_ had thought that for either woman or ship to be safe in harbour
like that was better than any more picturesque finale.... Well! I don’t know....

*       *       *       *       *

We reached the flagstaff, and set down our pots of paint among the buffets of
gorse that had sprays of purple ling and blue scabious growing through and
making a bouquet of each. Billy’s shirt-sleeves are always rolled up to the
elbow; the sleeves of my white cotton frock are three-quarter length; so we were
both equipped for work, though I’d refused the offer of Mrs. Roberts’ sackcloth
apron. It was _too_ coal-y and butter-y and paraffiny and scented with hen! But
here the heady warm fragrance of the gorse almost drowned the smell of our
paints. “Scarlet, and black, and white? Scarlet for her hat and jacket, eh?”
suggested Billy. “And how are we going to paint her hands and face? What
colour’s flesh?”

“Some people say it’s just the colour of honeysuckle,” I answered absently. I
can’t be perfectly certain that he _did_ retort so sharply, below his breath,
“_Does_ he, indeed!” or that the name of Sydney Vandeleur had been threatening
to crop up once more between us. Still, I was glad of the wide pink shelter of
my sun-bonnet as I added, in a matter-of-fact way, “You _could_ get a sort of
flesh-tint by mixing a little of the red with the white paint, but I don’t think
I should. Suppose we leave the face and hands creamy-white as they are?”

“Very well; and her lips red, and the jacket and that toque affair, with more
dabs of scarlet for the flowers in her bunch,” he said, kneeling on the sun-
warmed turf on the other side of the figure from me, “with a black wing in her
hat.”

“And her hair left as it is, too,” said I. “No, no! I got this on purpose for
her hair,” he said, and drew a full brushful of tar-black paint across the
carven and crinkly locks in front, “she must be a brunette, this time.”

“Oh, and Mrs. Roberts will be so annoyed to see her without her beautiful golden
chignon,” I protested, working away with the scarlet paint at the back of the
jacket, “she’ll think she’s quite spoilt.”

“Nonsense; looks much better like this,” he declared. “A black-haired woman
looks so much more _alive_ than the others. Like red wine, dark grapes, crimson
roses ... fairer colours are insipid, washed-out-looking!”

“No woman thinks so,” said I. “You never hear of a blonde tinting herself dark.
It’s always the other way about!”

“I know _one_ girl who wouldn’t change,” he argued, glancing over the shoulder
of the wooden woman at the border of dark hair between my bonnet and my face.
“You needn’t pretend you would, miss! Now what are you smiling at?”

“Only something,” I said, “that I’d just remembered.”

“Yes? (You’re an unexpected sex, aren’t you?) Well, what was this?”

“Only—look out, Billy, you’ll let that black drop run down the side of her
face—only something a girl I know said about fair men being like weak tea!”

“Meaning to say, I suppose, that she didn’t think much of _your_ taste in
_fiancés_?” suggested Billy Waters, with a mischievous laugh. I laughed too. And
for the several score of times since we have been here together, I thought to
myself what a delightful and unusual and thoroughly satisfactory arrangement
this friendship of ours had turned out to be. I never dreamed that at that very
moment _the life of that friendship had about five more minutes to run_.
“There!” said Billy, picking himself up and taking a few steps back from the
figure, to survey it, with his fair head on one side. “You can’t say it isn’t an
improvement. What would your friend say to that coloured hair?”

“Strong tea,” I suggested flippantly. “Tea that’s stood too long!”

“You aren’t looking at it. Come over here and see!”

I straightened myself and went and stood beside him. “As a matter of fact,
Nancy, the lady’s got rather a look of _you_!”

And actually something in the contrast of the glistening black locks against the
creamy-pale face with the now scarlet-tinted lips might have been vaguely
characteristic of what, night and morning, I see in my own mirror. “Well, but I
hope _I_ don’t look as if I ‘made up’ my mouth!”

“Why, you _don’t_ make it up, do you?”

“Of _course_ not,” said I. And then I turned from looking at the painted figure
to the other deeper, tenderer colour of the sea washing a strip of sand below
the cliff. “Oh, it _is_ lovely here,” I sighed, revelling in the beauty of that
and the sky. “Did you ever _see_ anything so blue as it is to-day?”

“Or so golden?” added Billy, nodding towards the hassocks of gorse in full
bloom. “I’ve never seen it like this before. D’you know that there’s a Welsh
proverb that calls this county ‘the land of thriftless gold’? Rather pretty,
isn’t it? It must have been wonderful here in the spring; this is the second
crop, you know. A man I know once told me that it was like falling in love.”

“How d’you mean?” I asked, as he stopped. “Aren’t you going to paint the wing in
her hat while you’ve that brush full of black paint?”

“Presently.—Oh, yes, about that gorse. He said the first blooming was more
showy—more fuss made over it—first love, you know, and all that; but that it was
nothing like as sweet as the later time. Should you agree with him, d’you
think?”

“How _should_ I know?” I retorted rather flippantly, to hide my intense surprise
that Billy should possess—let alone quote!—a friend who sounded so utterly
unlike himself. “You might know me well enough by this time to see I’m not that
sort of girl!”

“Which sort of girl? The kind who doesn’t fall in love a second time?”

“The kind who doesn’t fall in love at all,” I said decidedly. “Anyhow, I find
the second blooming of the gorse, without any metaphors, quite beautiful enough
against that dragonfly-blue bit of Bay!”

“Ah, yes! You’re fond of the effect of flowering plants against the blue sea, as
I think you mentioned, the evening my uncle dined at The Lawn,” said Billy,
teasingly and unexpectedly. “Only, didn’t you specify oleanders and myrtles and
the Riviera——”

“Oh, Billy! I never thought you’d do that,” I interrupted him with real
reproach. “No; I _never_ thought you’d be so mean as to remind me, ever again,
of that ghastly evening! I didn’t!”

There was silence for a moment. He stared down at me. I wouldn’t look at him. I
turned to look at a brown velvet bee that was buzzing some flattery or other
into the golden ear of a gorse-blossom near by. Then I heard him say slowly:

“‘Ghastly,’ you call it?”

“Well—! Of _course_!”

“I see,” he said, still more slowly. “You mean that it still rankles. You
haven’t forgotten.... You resent that still, in spite of agreeing to be friends
... in spite of letting one suppose that—well! that it _wasn’t_ so sickeningly
hard for you now, after all. You _do_ bear a grudge then, still. You mean—” It
came out, the last thing I ever expected to hear him mention!—“that about that
kiss!”

“That?” I retorted quickly, and with my airiest laugh, for this seemed the only
way in which to face the paralysingly embarrassing point he’d seen fit to raise
again. “Oh, that! I never gave it a thought, Billy! I quite understood! Besides,
you couldn’t possibly call that private-theatricals sort of peck a _kiss_,
exactly!”

“No,” he returned, as quickly. “You couldn’t, could you?”

He took a step towards me, then caught me to him by the shoulders, and for a
second I thought he was going to gratify the longing which I’d seen in his eyes
any time during that first week of my stay at The Lawn. I thought he was going
to shake me. But no. In quicker time than it can be told, his hands had flown
from my shoulders to the pink strings of my sun-bonnet; he’d untied them and
tossed the bonnet on to the nearest hassock of a gorse-bush. He put both brown
hands under my chin and turned my face up to his. Before I could so much as
gasp, he swooped down and kissed me, muttering, “But what could you call
this—and this—and this?” Three times—greedily—on the mouth. *       *       *
*       *

For a second I had to clutch at his shoulder to steady myself; for sea and cliff
and gorse seemed wheeling round me in swirls of blue and green and gold. Then I
wrenched myself away and faced him—without seeing too distinctly what was in
front of my eyes. “Don’t say anything to me,” I heard myself tell him, in a
voice that sounded unnaturally quiet and calm. “This—this can’t be forgiven.
Don’t ask.”

I heard him begin to say something about: “Do you think I am made of——”

“Don’t speak to me again, please,” I said, still in that unnaturally quiet
voice. “Not again.”

I snatched up my sun-bonnet from the gorse-bush, rammed it down over my hair,
and tied the strings so tightly beneath my chin that they nearly throttled me.
Then I turned, saying, “I forbid you to follow me,” and left him standing there
between cliff and sky, beside the wooden woman. I walked on until I thought I
was out of his sight, then I ran; ran blindly across the cove and up the sandy
path to the cottages. On the doorstep of the larger one Theo was sitting,
emptying her white canvas shoes of sand on to the cobbles of the garden path.
“Hullo, Nancy! Do you know that Cariad was so bored with you that he ran home?”
she said. “What have you done with Billy the Beloved? Is he——”

“Let me pass, please,” I said quietly, and walked swiftly into the house. The
kitchen door was open and Mrs. Roberts was laying the table for the mid-day
meal. She began, “Was you finiss paint the——” but I couldn’t stop to speak to
her. I ran up the rickety wooden stairs to my bedroom. There isn’t a lock on the
door; I looked. So I just latched it, and went and sat down on my bed, with its
patchwork quilt of faded pinks and mauves. I began tracing with my fingers the
pattern made by the hexagonal patches of purple. I don’t think I thought of
anything at all. And I don’t know how long I’d been sitting there before I heard
light steps on the staircase and a tap at the door. I raised my voice a little.
“Don’t come in.”

“Nancy,”—it was Blanche—“dinner’s ready!”

“I don’t want any dinner. I am not coming down.”

“Oh!—What’s the matter, dear?”—with quick concern. “Are you ill?”

“No! I’m not ill!”

“Have you got a headache?”

“No! I haven’t got a headache. Only please go away. I don’t want to see
anybody.”

I heard her go softly downstairs again—then the kitchen door opening, and a
murmur of voices. His voice. *       *       *       *       *

Ah! that brought my anger surging over me at last like a great wave. I sat bolt
upright, with a crumple of the quilt clutched in each hand. How dared he! How
_dared_ he! Taking odious advantage of a situation! _This_ was not what I agreed
to when I said I would be nominally engaged to him. _This_ was not unavoidable,
like that last time. Oh! He needn’t have pointed out to me the difference
between that time and this! I’d _thought_ I was angry then. My anger now was as
different a thing as the difference between those two sorts of kisses. _Oh!_

_He’s_ broken the contract—he knows that it was tacitly understood that there
should be nothing of this—In fact, it wasn’t so much as thought of—_ever_.
_Right_ on my mouth!... Well, I don’t owe him anything after this. I shan’t
speak to him again. I shall have nothing more to do with him. He’s a right to my
name as his official _fiancée_, he can keep that—at a distance! My name—nothing
else. I shan’t go on staying with his people after this! Let him make what
excuse he chooses to his mother about that. Let him explain it away as he likes.
I shan’t help him! If it were to save his life, I’d never lift a finger to help
him again! I shall go away at once....

How could he! Whether it was a vulgar attempt at flirtation, or simply that he
was riled and meant to be rude to me in the most brutal manner he could think
of—I don’t care which it was! What had I said—done—looked—that he should imagine
he might? After this, he might even say I’d encouraged him! Hateful, _hateful_!
Well, I shall go away....

Brute! To-morrow, I shall _go_! CHAPTER XXIII

“MANY WATERS——”

Well! Anyhow there’s no sense in sitting up in my room brooding over this thing,
on a heavenly afternoon like this and all. I’m not going to miss it all just to
please _him_. And if I am leaving everything—sea and sunshine and mountains—to-
morrow, I may as well take in as much of them as I can to-day. Besides, I
suppose I shall have to go down some time. There are these people—whoever they
are—expected this afternoon. Obviously I shall have to be at tea to meet them? I
shouldn’t in the least mind letting _him_ down by remaining invisible until I’m
all packed up and ready for the little local train that must take me up to
Holyhead to meet the Euston mail. But there is his mother to consider—she has
been so sweet to me from the beginning. What I can’t understand about her is how
she ever managed to have such a son? There must have been something odd and
horrid about the father; and he must take after him. The _girls_ are all right.
There they are, going out now; down the sandy path to the station; Theo bare-
legged and bare-headed as usual, swinging a basket; off to buy jam, I expect,
for the visitors’ tea; Blanche carrying letters. I heard his step on the cobbles
ten minutes ago, and Mrs. Waters always rests in her room until three o’clock.
The coast’s quite clear, then. Why shouldn’t I go out and have my bathe? I
missed it this morning—thanks to all _that_! Perhaps the cool green waves of the
Bay will help me to feel as if I’d washed a little of that memory away from me.
Already it seems years since my last bathe; only yesterday morning! When the
girls and I ran down together, to find him already in, practising walking under
the water; and he’d called out “I say! Isn’t it topping to be alive on a day
like this?” as he emerged, head up once more, dripping and glowing in his
indigo-blue sheath, his hair sleek once more with the wet, his arms and
shoulders as smooth and pinky-white as any of ours, but making ours look
curiously slender and delicate. Years ago! Everything had been so different! I’d
thought _he_ was so different. Well! This will be my last bathe for the summer,
so I may as well enjoy it, all to myself. *       *       *       *       *

I undressed quickly, slipped into my black woven silk club costume, and twisted
round my head the long orange silk scarf that keeps my hair from getting too
wet. I simply won’t take to one of those sponge-bag-like rubber caps that some
girls still wear for bathing. They’re too unsightly for anything—and one doesn’t
exactly want to look a blot on the seascape, even if there doesn’t happen to be
anyone else bathing, to see one....

As it happened, I found, to my great annoyance, that there was someone else
already in the little cove next to the cottages that it was Theo’s idea to
christen “The Bay of _Many Waters_.” There was a smooth head, some distance out,
dark against the afternoon glitter; a steady stroke that I knew. _Oh!_

So he’d come out first! Well, that meant that I couldn’t have my bathe here
after all—just like him!... Fresh rage against him surged up in me as I caught
up the white wrap of Turkey-towelling that I had thrown down upon a seaweedy
rock with my string-soled shoes. I’d leave him to it. Perhaps I could get a dip
in the next bay under that cliff where the wooden woman leaned forward to her
watch? But, even as I turned to slip away, I heard a sound from across the water
that seemed to make my heart, for a second, stop its beating. It was a choking
shout for help. “Nancy!—Here!—Here!”

Then that dark head disappeared under the water. It couldn’t possibly have been
for as long as it _seemed_. No! People can’t hold their breath for as long. Then
it was up again. The swimmer had flung himself on his back and was floating. And
I—without actually realizing what I had been doing, I must have cast off my wrap
again, have splashed through the creamy surf of the first waves into the
smoother jade-green depths beyond, for I found myself swimming, striking out,
out—from the shore.... Still I didn’t know how I’d started—or why. Except that
here was a human being in trouble whom, somehow or other, I had to help. I
didn’t think about who it was. It wasn’t because of that broken shout of
“_Nancy!_” I’m sure. No; I am sure that, just then, no thought of saving Still
Waters was in my mind. It was just another human being who had called to me; and
towards whom I swam so desperately, making, in my hurry, such a splashing over
each stroke that it seemed to me endless before I came up to where he floated on
his back. Automatically I remembered something our swimming-instructor had
drilled into us at school. I found myself telling myself that it was
dangerous—dangerous to get within reach of a drowning person’s hands. They’d
grip you, and you’d both go under. “Keep behind him,” I was telling myself.
“Keep behind him!”

But there was no need for me to trouble about avoiding his clutch. When he
spoke, I realized that he, in his danger, was keeping his head far better than I
was. He was calm. “Cramp,” I heard him say, “in my left leg. You’ll have to tow
me. Can you swim on your back?”

“Yes.”

Whether I could or not, I supposed, I should have to. So in turn I flung myself
on my back, and caught hold of him under those hard, strong-feeling arms of his.
Then began the struggle back to shore. The tide was setting in, thank heaven!
and as long as we were in the deep waters it was not so hard. Presently we came
to where the waves began to break. The wind was blowing off the shore, blowing
the surfy crests of the waves backwards as a girl’s hair is blown across her
face ... and presently I was half blinded by the spray that dashed over my head,
into my eyes and mouth. I choked, panted....

“Rest a minute,” said a voice close to me. “No hurry. The tide will take us both
in.” ... But, getting my breath, I struggled on again, yard by yard. Again I got
a mouthful; spluttered, coughed. “All right—all right—take it easy!” the voice
was saying. I simply couldn’t pay any attention to that—I was labouring with all
my strength for both—for myself and this log in the water that I must—_must_ get
ashore. I was startled when he gave a sudden powerful jerk of his shoulders that
altered our course. “You’ll have us on to the reef,” he said. “I’ll steer—don’t
work so hard—”

I heard myself gasping. —“don’t get flurried, Nancy!”

“Nancy!” Yes! Then I did realize who it was that I was tugging along with me for
dear life. His life was in my hands—mine, when I’d felt ready to murder him an
hour ago. I’d had to save it.... “Serve him right,” I thought wildly, as I
struggled along. “Oh, serve him right! I’ll show him—I’ll teach him to kiss me
again.”

Indeed, I’m not sure that I wasn’t muttering this aloud to myself in the water.
Anyhow, voices seemed buzzing in my ears—one was his own as I’d heard it
yesterday—“I say! Isn’t it topping to be alive? Isn’t it topping to be alive?”

And then it seemed to come to the very last effort I could make. “_Ah!_” I heard
myself groan. The next thing of which I was conscious came with a shock of
surprise. It was the soft jolt of my shoulders against sand. We were aground!
For a minute or so I must have been swimming furiously in my depth, without even
feeling the growing warmth of the shallows about me. I let go my wild, unneeded
clutch of his arms, staggered to my feet, waded in, then dropped again, face
downwards and panting, on to the beach, a few yards below the tide-mark of
crisp, black seaweed, straws, and broken shell. It was over—we were safe. And
now—what? I didn’t know. Anyhow, for a moment I lay there unable to rise or
speak. I threw my arm across my eyes. Then I found that he’d dragged himself up
beside me. He was leaning over me; saying something I was too dazed to catch. I
didn’t want to hear it. I didn’t want him to say anything. He needn’t suppose
I’d intended to save his life. He needn’t think this absurd crisis had made any
difference. There was still this morning between us. There always would be. This
made no difference. None! None at all! I got up again, hearing my teeth chatter
a little. I turned to the rock where I’d thrown down my peignoir, and as I did
so, I heard him behind me raise his voice a little:

“I say! I can’t, you know!—You’ll have to help me up to the cottages, I’m
afraid—”

I glanced down at him; he was sitting up, his face a little white under the tan,
but quiet and expressionless. And as I looked at him, sitting there backed by
the empty, sunlit cove and the cliff with the figure-head and flagstaff small as
toys in the distance, I passed through the one second’s most extraordinary
experience of my life. Was it a waking-dream, or what? The result of shock and
over-exertion, like those buzzing voices, just before, among the waves? For of
all the mad, impossible fancies to dash into one’s mind—before one’s eyes,
even!—this was the maddest. This was what happened in that second’s space:

_Vividly there flashed before me a picture of my own Self just as I was then, in
my black silk maillot with my wet black hair streaming down my neck; for I’d
lost my scarf, it floated like a torn-off strand of orange-coloured seaweed on
the waves. I saw it there.... And I saw that mind-picture of myself fling
herself down on her knees beside him again—fling herself into his arms, cold
from the sea-water and dripping and hard; saw her bury her face against his
throat; heard, more clearly than in a dream, her gasping sob of, “Billy! You
were drowning! I might have lost you!”_

Then—flick! the picture vanished, and I was drawing my wrap about me composedly
enough as I replied to him coldly, “I will help you up—on one condition. That
you don’t speak to me.”

He said quietly, “You prefer that?”

“Only on that condition,” I repeated. “Very well,” he rose slowly to his feet,
trying them one after the other in the sand. “Only—I’m afraid I shall have to
lean on you a bit—not hard.”

So, after I’d helped him on with his own wrap, I stood for him to put his arm
about my shoulders. I don’t know if he leaned hard or no. Slowly and in silence,
we walked up so from the shore to the cottages. Just before we got to the sandy
path in front, his arm dropped, and he smothered an exclamation:

“Hul-_lo_!”

For, tilted up between the deep ruts made by Mr. Roberts’ cart in the sand in
front of the cottage gardens, we caught sight of a motor-car; a gaudy, cherry-
coloured affair, all ablaze with sunlit brass. The visitors. They’d come, then.
I’d forgotten _them_. They were in my cottage at tea, I discovered, after he had
turned quickly in at the little gate of the cottage he shares with Blanche; from
behind the door of the kitchen sitting-room of our larger one I heard a babble
of talk and much laughter. Must I face it? With this dreadful day behind me?
Slowly I mounted the wooden stairs to my room and began to dress. I was, all of
a sudden, deadly tired; why, I felt only half awake; what I would have liked
would have been to fling myself down on that patchwork-quilted bed and sleep the
time away until I was to leave Porth Cariad for ever. That this must needs have
happened this afternoon, to add to the conglomeration of things between him and
me that I longed to forget! After the way he behaved this morning! (Ah, Billy,
why did you? We were such chums!) _Caddish_ of him! To think that he
_might_—that I could be treated so! That fact remained—and all the waves in the
Bay of Many Waters hadn’t washed any of its bitterness away. As for that mad,
mad fancy of mine afterwards on the beach—well! it must have been something like
the way people declare that the whole of a drowning person’s past life rises
before them in the moment of peril. Only, of course, those would be pictures of
things that had happened—not the reverse of anything that ever, ever _could_
happen! One thing—I’d never let him thank me for the outwardly magnanimous act
into which I’d been just forced, and which had left me too utterly exhausted
even to rage over it as I might. My arms felt almost too limp to raise to my
head as I wrung my streaming hair into a towel and pinned it, still wet, firmly
about my head. It took me minutes to put on each garment. Meantime those minutes
were ebbing away, and these people downstairs were being kept waiting, expecting
to see his official _fiancée_ at the tea-table. And if I felt I couldn’t stay up
here as I longed to do, it wasn’t on his account. It wasn’t the girl he’d
engaged—and insulted so!—it was his mother’s guest who confronted in the wavy
looking-glass her very washed-out appearance, her dark, ringed eyes and damp
hair plastered down to keep it from dripping on to the first clean blouse that
had come to hand. Certainly I looked very little credit to him! With a shrug I
turned away and went downstairs. *       *       *       *       *

The warm kitchen seemed full of people and their voices, and of a mingled scent
of brewing tea and warm butter and—could it be a whiff of perfume: _trèfle_? The
tea-table was crowded with Mrs. Roberts’ gayest crockery, with her largest black
teapot, with mounds of yellow light-cakes and clusters of brown eggs and great
slabs of Welsh farmhouse bread-and-butter. In the middle a glass jug held a
bouquet of heather and honeysuckle and blue scabious. There was a dish of damson
jam, and a very golden, “shoppy” cake. At the head of the table, Mrs. Waters was
entertaining a stout, sallow gentleman with a black moustache and a plaid tie,
who was talking French very fast and with a good deal of gesture. Blanche,
elbows on the table, was leaning eagerly across it to talk; opposite to her were
her brother, looking much as usual again, I saw, and Theodora in a state of
flushed animation, from whom, in the general babble, I caught something that
sounded like “tell Billy’s sweetheart—” and between Theodora and him there sat,
leaning back in her chair and laughing gaily, a young girl in a wonderfully-cut
and simple get-up of flame-yellow and white and cream, with a swirl of feathery
yellow about her midnight black hair; one of the prettiest girls I’d ever seen
in my life. Ah! it was she who’d brought in that whiff of clover-scent? She was
laughing up into his face. And she was calling my official _fiancé_ “Billy.”

CHAPTER XXIV

THAT GIRL

There was a scraping of wooden chair-legs on the tiled kitchen floor as I came
in, and the men rose. Mrs. Waters introduced “Our friend Monsieur Charrier and
his daughter”—and the stout gentleman, who wore pale-hued boots shaped like the
blades of oars, bowed until I could see the rolls of fat beneath his collar
behind, then shot at me out of eyes like two black currants a glance that made
me feel utterly disapproved-of and “found wanting.” The girl gave me a look less
frankly measuring, while the whitest teeth in the world flashed in her little
face, oval and smoothly olive as the shell of one of those eggs on the table.
She was very lovely....

She held out her hand and gave mine the violent shake that foreigners seem to
think so truly English; and then I slipped into the empty place next to Blanche,
feeling thankful for the tea which Mrs. Waters handed to me in a large cup
decorated with a group of Welsh women in the costume never seen except on china.
I drank it in a kind of thirsty dream; I couldn’t have talked to save anyone’s
life just then; but the talk was buzzing on all around. “—planned to go to-
morrow; but shall you be here?”

“—since we find ourselves in such charming neighbourhood, we could prolong our
sojourn——”

“Oh, yes, _do_ prolong it! So ripping for Blanche and me to have Odette to go
about with! Of course, we never _see_ Billy and Nancy here!”

“Don’t believe her, Odette!” he was laughing quite naturally. “—can’t call your
shore your own, this year! _You_ don’t know what it is to have an engaged couple
in the place!”

“No? It is not agreeable?” The pretty French girl turned to smile at him again.
“You do not encourage me to come, so!”

“I’m writing a book about it——”

“Theo dear, finish your tea and don’t talk so much!”

“‘The Complete Gooseberry’ it’s called, if you know what that means.”

“Ah! Place where you find the little babies! Yes?”

“No! not place! People! Unengaged ones like us and you and everybody but
_Them_.”

“—Enchanted, madame!”

“—with rules like this: ‘_Don’t cough outside doors; they hate it. Far better
not go in_!’”

“—More hot water, please, Blodwen——”

“—_Don’t stalk them with a camera. You never get anything worth printing!_”

“—And will I bring a two more fress negg, mam?”

“_If one of them’s away, don’t ask who’s got the ink!_”

“—No, but do you remember the bathing at Dinard?”

“—Next year, perhaps——”

“—start before lunch——”

“—if the tide’s right——”

“—But Monsieur Charrier, as you were saying——”

“—icy!”

“—as warm as warm!”

“How was it to-day, Nancy?”

“Nancy, I believe you stayed in too long, dear,” murmured Mrs. Waters gently to
me as she passed my cup down again. “Oh, I don’t think so,” I said vaguely,
trying to smile at her. She was the only one of the party to whom I felt I could
turn in my utter fatigue and bewilderment. For in that party I felt myself as a
sort of plain and neglected little nursery-governess. It seemed impossible that
anyone should ever have admired _me_—that Major Montresor had ever paid me
compliments—or Sydney wanted to marry me!—or that, for at least a moment, my
employer had found me attractive enough to flirt with. I hadn’t looked at him,
but I knew he hadn’t glanced once at me. His attention was entirely divided
between Monsieur Charrier, to whom he listened with a deference new to me, and
that pretty French fashion-plate in white and cream and tango-colour, who
laughed whenever her host said anything at all. Yes! She was very lovely. She
made me feel dowdy and drab and _gauche_ beyond words. Even at my best I should
have felt that she outshone me; even if I did possess longer eyelashes and a
flush of pink and a dimple, what were these compared with the finished _chic_ of
the way she wore hair and clothes—to her scintillating vivacity? No wonder the
man beside her was so obviously lost in admiration of her! Men adore a girl
who’s “_bright_,” who amuses them while she saves them the trouble of thinking
what to say. I believe that somewhere at the back of every man’s mind there’s a
fancy portrait of himself, in a sultan’s turban, applauding condescendingly
while some fair dancing-girl postures and performs for his pleasure. _Men!_ Even
the ones who have seemed “whitest,” as Jack calls it, turn out to be cads in the
end. Trying to flirt with the girl to whom you’re nominally engaged, and whom
you’ll never marry, is the sort of “joke” that appeals to a masculine sense of
humour. Yes, even when the possessor happens to be really attracted by quite
another girl. For it didn’t take me many seconds of silent looking-on to see
what game was being played between my employer and that girl. “Odette, are these
your gloves?”

He picked them up from the floor when at last we all rose. “_Your_ gloves,
Billy,” retorted Mademoiselle Charrier gaily. “Still a pair from the beautiful
great box you bought me. You remember, yes?”

“Ah, the box you won from me at that flying-meeting. Of course I remember.”

And I too remembered hearing of those gloves and this bet, ages ago—the
afternoon after I had been out to lunch for the first time with my official
_fiancé_. So this was the young French girl he’d told me about! And as I watched
them standing chatting together, a little apart from the group round the motor
outside, I suddenly gave a quick guess at something else he might have had to
tell me about her if he’d chosen. _This very girl had something to do with his
official engagement to me!_ Somehow or other, she was his “reason” for appearing
to have a _fiancée_ at all—a _fiancée_ upon whom he’d been so particular to
impress that “this affair would never end in marriage!” Possibly my employer and
that girl were already secretly—but really, not nominally—betrothed to one
another? It looked like it. It looked uncommonly like it. At something he said
she blushed quite rosily. Oh, and they mustn’t think I didn’t notice her shake
of the head and her quick little silencing frown at my official _fiancé_ when
her father, in a tea-coloured alpaca dust-coat, at last left off fussing over
his engines and asked them if they—calling them “_mes enfans_”—were ready to
start? “Oh—but are you going too, then, Billy?” his mother put in quickly.
Monsieur Charrier answered with a flow of French about “_affaires_,” and
documents which he had left at his hotel in Holyhead, which it would be so much,
so much better if Mr. Waters would spare but a little half-hour to investigate.
“Very good of you to give me the opportunity, sir,” said Mr. Waters. “I can get
a train back, mother.”

“Ah, but no, but no! The auto will be again at your service as soon as we have
dined at that dog of an hotel,” declared the stout Frenchman. “I will bring your
son home quite safely, madame, to you and”—with a particularly hollow show of
politeness—“to mademoiselle!”

Here his daughter murmured something about the four seats in the auto, plenty of
space for mademoiselle his _fiancée_ if she would deign to accompany——

I expect Mademoiselle Charrier knew well enough how safe it was to issue that
invitation! So did my employer, when he struck in with “Ah, that’s very nice of
you,” then turned and addressed me directly for the first time since we had
walked up from the beach together. “Yes! That would be a good idea, wouldn’t it?
You’ll come along too, won’t you, Nancy? We could get a trap back.”

I excused myself as naturally as I could manage it, with something about being
rather tired. It was true enough. As that cherry-coloured car panted, jerked,
then whizzed off down the stone-wall-bordered Holyhead road, with its trio of
passengers, I felt almost as if it had driven straight over me. And I felt as if
I shouldn’t have cared very much one way or the other if it had! CHAPTER XXV

THE FIRST AVOWAL

I suppose I must have dropped off to sleep directly I threw myself down on my
bed, and have slept for some time. It was growing dusk in my little bedroom;
outside my window veils of purple gauze were drawn over sand-hills and shore,
and the tide was far out again by the time I was awakened by a tap at my bedroom
door. “Yes?” I called drowsily, wondering, for a second, where I was, and what
horrible thing it was that seemed lying in wait for me to wake up properly and
remember it. The door opened and Mrs. Waters came in, carrying a little tray.
“I’ve brought you this, dear.” It was a glass of ginger wine with two biscuits
laid over the top of it. “I know you stayed in the water too long this
afternoon; you were done up. Drink it up, child.”

I sat up, and she put out her hand to smooth my damp hair while I finished the
glassful. “That’s better, isn’t it?”

“Much, thank you,” I sighed gratefully; for the wine had seemed very heartening,
and heartening was what I needed. The horrible memory had come back to me. Two
of them, in fact: that of this morning, even before that of this afternoon. His
mother knew nothing of either; _that_ I read in the pink, December rose of a
face under the grey hair. The dear! and I must leave her....

“I’ve brought you something else too,” she said, almost shyly, like a schoolgirl
who isn’t sure that she won’t be snubbed; “something you’ll like.”

She put her hand to her soft black muslin bodice, unfastened something that was
hidden inside, and brought out a thin, old-fashioned pendant of flat gold, slung
on a slender golden chain. She opened it and held it out to me. I took it in my
hand and carried it to the window, where there was still enough light by which
to see it well. Coiled up below the oval glass, faintly gold as thistle-down in
sunshine, and fine as floss-silk, there was a baby’s curl. “That was the very
first curl I ever cut from Billy, the day that he was christened,” his mother
told me softly, sitting on the side of my bed, while I stood, not knowing how to
speak to her, by the window. “He had such pretty hair always!” she went on,
“quite as pretty as Theo’s is now. Only boys—men always seem to look upon curly
hair as a sort of affliction; they’re never satisfied unless they’re flattening
it out with brushes and horrid stuff out of bottles, are they? And when we all
go back to Sevenoaks again, Nancy—”

I lifted my head to try to interrupt her, to say something about my being forced
to go away before, but no words came; she went on talking, as if more to herself
than to anyone else, of what seemed, just then, almost unbearable to me. —“I’ll
show you heaps of other little things that belonged to him as a baby. His very
first tiny shirt! They put new babies into shirts then, you know. Fine linen,
with narrow, real lace round the neck and the little sleeves.... Oh, of course I
know those silk-and-wool vests they have now are much more sensible. I’m _quite_
modern, really. Still—there’s a lovely embroidered christening-robe of his ...
all his robes. I made others for Blanche and Theo. I’d a fancy to keep them all
separate, so that when they—my babies!—grew up and married they could have them
handed on. So all Billy’s will be for you, Nancy—and the little locket. I knew
you’d care to keep it.”

“I?” I cried, aghast and huskily. I held it back to her. “Oh, no! It’s not for
me!”

“Of course it is. I always meant to give it to his bride on her wedding-
morning.”

“Then you keep it for—for her, until then,” I broke in, with a little laugh that
sounded wild in my own ears, and I pressed the pendant with the christening-day
curl back into his mother’s hand. She said nothing for a moment. Presently, in
the dusk, I felt her long arm slip round me, and her hesitating, gentle voice
was saying very earnestly and pitifully: “Nancy! You do care for my boy, don’t
you?”

And then into that day of queer and crowded horrible happenings, there was
packed yet another. In my own ears I heard my own voice answering his mother’s
appeal with words I could scarcely recognize as my own. Yet it was no freak of
imagination this time. It was no mad fancy like that on the beach. It was I,
Monica Trant, who in that voice so shaking and strained cried desperately:

“Oh, yes! _Yes!_ You _know_ I care for him!”

And with that avowal in my ears I felt as if some stranger had cried aloud a
secret that I had never even guessed, but that now—_now_ I knew to be coming
true. I found myself putting out my hands before me, almost as if this growing
knowledge were something that I could hold away from myself. For a time I must
hold it away; I _must_! For at least as long as I remained here. I clenched my
hands tightly, dropping them to my sides, using all my will to bring myself to
speak in my usual voice again. “Will you tell me what time it is, Mrs. Waters?”

“Half-past seven. You’ll go to bed early, dear, won’t you? You won’t stop up!”

“No, I’ll go to bed.”

“And to-morrow—Nancy, I don’t want to say much more. Only, Life promises to be
so golden, dear, for you and him!”

It was then that she gave me a sting that I wish I could forget. I _shall_
forget, but not at once, that his mother said:

“_Fate has been merciful to let you two meet._ Don’t let that be spoiled! To-
morrow——”

I held her hand with that little locket in it clutched for a minute against my
breast. “It shall be different to-morrow,” I whispered before she went, keeping
my meaning to myself. It will, of course, be “different” enough! *       *
*       *       *

Half-past seven. There was just time, then, to send my wire. I crept out
silently over the sand-hills and away to the tiny post office where, thank
goodness, the postmistress’s literal English won’t allow her to read much
between the lines of this. “To Harradine, Marconi Mansions, Battersea, London.
“Please send off immediately to Trant, care Waters, Porth     Cariad, Anglesey,
telegram as follows: (Begins.) ‘Please return     at once; am ill, must see you,
Cicely.’ (Ends. )—From TOTS.”

If she only has the sense to answer that correctly, and at once! CHAPTER XXVI

“ALL CHANGE HERE”

Cicely’s answering wire—for a wonder correctly worded—arrived this morning at
breakfast as I came down. I’ve shown it to the Waters: explained that I must be
off at once. Only Theo protested angrily, “Your chum ill? How _careless_ of her
just when we were such a jolly party, and going to Red Wharf Bay with the
Charriers to-morrow, and all!” The others accepted it with scarcely a word. They
didn’t even show that they found it odd that Miss Harradine, who lives in
Battersea, should hand her telegram in at Euston Station—though I wondered over
that myself. Not even Mrs. Waters said a word to press me to wait and send a
nurse instead; she didn’t ask when I thought I might come back. If she _looked_
questions I didn’t see them; I was steadfastly keeping my eyes for breakfast-
cups, and clocks, and time-tables, and anything but the faces of these people
I’m going to leave—for good. All the morning I’ve spent in my bedroom, packing-
up. Twice, while I was busily emptying drawers and laying out my things in
folded heaps on the bed, I heard outside my window a whistle like a blackbird’s
note; but this time I wasn’t taken in for a moment. I knew it wasn’t a
blackbird. I took no notice of him. I went on packing, laying my string-soled
bathing shoes at the bottom of my trunk. A long time before I shall need _those_
again! I let him whistle. He tried something else. Twice there was a sharp tap
on the pane, just as when that thrush was cracking a snail. But I knew that this
time it really was a pebble thrown up to catch my attention: thrown, not from
the trimly-gravelled sweep in front of a big house, but from the cottage garden
planted with sandy white pinks and lad’s-love—thrown to bring me down. I wasn’t
to be either whistled or tapped to his side. I rolled my sun-bonnet—there was a
little rip where it had caught on a gorse prickle—into a tight pink bundle and
rammed it down beside my shoes. I wasn’t going down. Then came a crunching on
the cobbles of the path below, and a soft call of “Nancy!”

Not I; I wasn’t going down. “Nancy!”—more urgently. “I say!”

No! Let him think what he liked of me—rude, obstinate, childish, or sullen—as
long as he only didn’t guess _why_ I didn’t mean to go down, or even look out
the window to answer him. I couldn’t face it now. Not with what my own lips had
first told me of the thing which I had to hold away from me, at arm’s length,
for as long as I had the strength. “Nancy!”

Evidently he was set on saying something to me—but whether it was about
yesterday morning or yesterday afternoon I didn’t care. I was equally set on his
not having the chance. Now I was afraid this chance would happen after lunch,
and I was grateful to that which prevented his taking me up to Holyhead and
seeing me off by the Euston mail alone. I rejoiced over the timely and snorting
arrival of that magenta-coloured “auto” of the Charriers, bringing over Monsieur
with some more of his business-documents, and Mademoiselle with business that a
child might guess at. I leaped at their proffered lift of luggage and all, back
to Holyhead Station, and the four of us went off together. Then, sitting beside
this French coquette, who seemed bent on seeming sweet to me—(Why? I suppose
because the girl to whom he _is_ engaged feels that it’s “in the picture” to be
generous to the girl he _has_ “engaged”)—my heart sank, and I wished I hadn’t
accepted. We were speeding along far too fast along the level road towards the
purple hump of the Holyhead mountain. We should be there too soon. Heavens!
There’d be half an hour to wait at the station, and he could get what he wanted
to say in then....

Why hadn’t I thought of that! If something would only happen.... It did. Never,
never has a motor breakdown been hailed with delight before by a passenger; but
I blessed the fortunate accident that kept Monsieur Charrier and my employer
fumbling, fidgeting and fuming about the bonnet for over half an hour by the
roadside. Mademoiselle, in her lemon-coloured wrap and daring little hat, sat on
the top of a low stone fence with me in my brown silk coat and skirt in which
I’d first travelled down to The Lawn. I was so delighted by the delay that I
could even laugh quite gaily at her as she chattered. “Always the same! Each
time that we take a passenger to make very quickly, there arrives this
_malheur_!... Now, now, it is good? it is well? it is right? No?... Regard my
father, Miss Nancy, on the earth under the auto nearly: he look like a little
fat dog that has been run over, not? Ah look at this brave Billy, always the
same idea, _encore un_ spanner! Now he will lick her into shapes!... It is
finish, Billy? No?... Ah, he is doing it express, on purpose.... You will loose
the train, and Mademoiselle must return with you—what a chancey day!”

*       *       *       *       *

Mercy! Return with him?—the midnight train would be impossible—I should be kept
until the next morning—Horrors! My heart was in my mouth at the thought.... It
was with two minutes to spare, however, that we flung ourselves, with the
hastiest of thanks, out of the motor, and rushed into the busy station that
stretches down to the quay, where a couple of slanted funnels seemed as big as
two leaning towers of Pisa painted red. No time to lose. He found me a corner-
seat facing the engine, in a carriage with one other lady. He attended to my
luggage with the speed and ease of a man who can make men obey, then he looked
straight at me and began: “I haven’t time now, but look here, I shall——”

Again I baffled him. “I have nothing to read!” I cried, as if in dismay over the
fact. “Will you fetch me a paper—anything.”

With a little jerk of his shoulders he turned away to the bookstall, and I sat
back in my corner looking dully out at the moving bustle on the platform below
the big Norman Wilkinson posters of steamboats on a moonlit sea. Why couldn’t we
start—it must be time! I’d said good-bye to his people, said it as if I were
going no further than for one of my afternoon tramps at Porth Cariad with him.
Now it was to him that I must say good-bye.... I couldn’t take it in yet. I
didn’t want to. Above all, I didn’t want him to say it—or anything else. Again
the situation was unexpectedly saved. The carriage-door burst open, and a man,
panting with haste, flung a cape and a blue-covered _English Review_ on to the
seat opposite mine, drew his handkerchief over his brow with a “Phew!” that
meant “Only just done it!” then leaped out again on to the platform, calling,
“Porter! when is this train due off?”

“She ought to be off now, sir; we’ve been kept back by the boat, we’re ten
minutes behind time.”

But it was not this that made me sit up and turn quickly to the man who’d
dropped back into the seat opposite to me. Slim shape, soft hat, Vandyke
profile—yes, I thought I’d recognized the voice. Sydney Vandeleur, of all
people—and at this moment! At any other, I might have longed to pick up that
_English Review_ and hurl it at his picturesque head, but, for just this one
occasion, I was overjoyed to see him. My employer wouldn’t be able to say any
last words now, before him. “Monica—Miss Trant!” exclaimed Sydney quickly. “How
odd! Did you see _her_?”

“See whom?”

“Why, Cicely!”

Cicely! The tone in which he used her Christian name told me all there was to
know, _there_! I’d thought so! “I’ve been seeing her off, you know, to
Ireland—the Dublin boat—just gone off.” He nodded towards the quay. “Had to get
back to London to-night; I am meeting the Mamma in Pont Street to-morrow
morning, and——”

“Take your seats, please! Take your seats!” The guard’s whistle was at his lips
as my official _fiancé_ came racing back along the platform. An armful of papers
and magazines fell on to my lap. “Here you are, Nancy. And, I say! I’m going
to——”

What he was going to say broke off again with a snap. And the last glance I had
of his blonde, sun-browned face and quick eyes showed them frozen in a stare of
utter astonishment at the sight of my travelling-companion. Yes—my goodness!
What would he think of finding me with Sydney again?—Sydney, whose name has so
often nearly cropped up between us. Would he think——? What difference would it
make if he did? The train steamed out of the station across the flat Anglesey
country, between marshlands ghostly-white with bog-cotton in the dusk.... What
would he think? This was what occupied me all the time Sydney was talking, for
he was in a mood to talk to anyone. I, for example, was not the Rose, but I had
shared rooms with the Rose, and he was eager to tell me about her, and how she
had gone to stay with his married sister until—something or other to do with
“the Mamma.” Poor Lady Vandeleur, fated to see her only son falling in love with
such totally ineligible girls! First a City typist at twenty-five shillings a
week; now a Bond Street mannequin! But my employer didn’t know of this change.
How could he? He probably—yes, certainly!—imagines things are as they might once
have seemed to be. Will he think I arranged this? “Of course you know her—but
not as one does now!—the last few weeks! We were together at the Café Royal—He’s
going to paint her—Colouring!—Wonderful! You should have seen the costume I
designed for her—Five Arts Ball——Purposely giving the effect of——Quite in the
period, of course!—People who understand!—Such _souplesse_ of mind as she has——”
Sydney went on to the air. My whole attention was for someone very different. He
can’t imagine I’d do anything so underhand! Even if he did imagine that—well, I
couldn’t explain unless he asked. If he did ask, I could explain less than ever!
Oh, why can’t I wipe four months straight out of this year and begin again? But
then, there would have been Jack to help! But then, there would have been
Sydney.... I should have been engaged to this creature before me in that hat,
talking of Cicely’s _souplesse_ of mind! If he—the other one—only knew what I
really think of Sydney! “Fancy,” I commented haphazard to the rhapsodist before
me. “Well; I do hope everything will be all right.” And I took up the magazine
my employer had tossed on to my lap—there was a picture on the cover of a pretty
Summer-girl looking over the sea—and prepared to hold it up in front of me for
the rest of the journey. Sydney—surprised and sulky—read his _English Review_.
Presently I refused his not too pressing invitation to join him in the dining-
car, and he left me for an hour and a half. For love, that robs us women of the
appetite for anything but Romance, seems to make men even hungrier for their
food. *       *       *       *       *

“Eus-tern!” came the familiar Cockney bawl again at last. “Eus-tern!”

It was a change, after what I’d been used to for the last few weeks, to have to
fend for myself in the matter of luggage and a taxi. One doesn’t specially look
to men in love for decent manners. Still—that other one knew how to pay these
attentions in spite of his Odette and her gloves! Sydney’s evidently the type
that pays homage to the Well-Beloved by being casual towards every other woman.
He seemed to efface himself until his lukewarm offer of getting me a cab could
be answered from the cab-window. “Ah—may I tell him to drive to Marconi
Mansions, Miss Trant?”

“I’ve told him, thanks. How fearfully hot it is here, and how stuffy”—I sniffed
with distaste—“after the country!”

“Yes, isn’t it?—one’s almost consoled for Her being away, in that lovely, soft,
pure air of Ballycool! Good night!”

The last sort of night I thought I’d have! But once back in my familiar little
camp-bed in Marconi Mansions, I tucked my cotton dressing-gown round me because
no sheets had been left out, and fell into that dreamless trance of utter
tiredness. I slept like a log all night. (_Next day._)

_How_ the flat seems to have shrunk! and what a state Cicely has left it in! Has
she moved _all_ our ramshackle furniture since I was here last? Used that table
to be right in the middle of the room, choking it up like this?—and where’s my
dear print of “Kitty Fisher” that used to hang just _there_, where she’s put
that framed oil-sketch of—what on _earth_? It looks like a study, by Blossom, of
that coloured tie of Sydney’s—and there’s a little red “_sold_” label on it. I
suppose he bought it for her out of one of the shows at the Grafton Gallery. The
couch, too, is littered with books ... Marinetti ... Schnitzer ... Tangore ...
Strindberg’s “_Stronger Woman_” ... a slender volume, “_The Everlasting Mercy_,”
inscribed “_To Cicely, from her devoted S. V._”

*       *       *       *       *

H’m! Cicely among the intellectuals? Well, I suppose some of us are made
adaptable as water, taking the shape of any vessel we’re poured into by Man.
Perhaps—perhaps I might have been the same, if——

But I do wish she’d had the _souplesse_ or the _something!_ to throw away,
before she left, this litter of florists’ half-dead flowers, expensive stale
roses and carnations, that fills up every one of our pots and crocks. I’d better
do it, I suppose....

Also I’d better wash up my breakfast-things—and Cicely’s of the day before,
which are heaped upon the kitchen table. On the top of an oily quarter-pound of
butter there’s a very dirty note. “_Dear Miss I am unable to come to-day has my
little girl is     queer hoping no inconvenence yrs truely mrs skinner._”

All right. I’ll wash up ... loathsome job! That kettle always took so long to
boil—we ought to have a flat-bottomed one like the one they use for picnics at
the Waters’. It’s a good thing I’m able to think so composedly of them. Doesn’t
it show, after all, that—what I told his mother, what I thought I should have to
hold away from myself so determinedly, may not really be true ... may not,
anyhow, be the deep and lasting sort of “true” that I imagined? Just a fancy, a
passing, summer-holiday attraction for someone who’ll never guess. It must—it
_shall_ be that. No harm in remembering him—all of them. Let’s see. To-day was
to be their excursion to Red Wharf Bay. I can see the whole party—and their
jolly, sun-browned faces against the throbbing blue of sea and sky. Odette
Charrier will be like some bright foreign bird just alighted amid the homely
gold of the Welsh gorse ... prattling away in her pretty broken English that I
believe she sometimes breaks on purpose to hear Billy Waters’ amused, boyish
laugh. They’ll be together all the time to-day—no official _fiancée_ to
intervene with even the shadow of a claim.... Together they’ll be unpacking the
picnic basket, hunting for the corkscrew, picking up big, sun-warmed pebbles
from the beach to lay at the corners of the white picnic cloth to keep it from
flying into the sea. The others will be—oh, somewhere about....

Those two will stroll off after lunch, I suppose. I wonder if they’ll bathe?
_He_ wouldn’t have lost his nerve even after that afternoon swim.... _Only
yesterday?_ They’ll bathe from the rocks, I expect. And I might still have been
there....

A ring at the door of the flat. Milk, Mrs. Skinner, or—what? I’d better go and
see....

*       *       *       *       *

They call _us_ the unexpected sex, of whom no man can ever say what we shall be
at next. What about themselves? Only last evening I’d left him standing, stiff
with astonishment, on the Holyhead platform. This morning here he was again,
blocking up the tiny entrance to our flat—my official _fiancé_! CHAPTER XXVII

PARTING COMPANY

Thank heaven for the instinct that silenced the welcoming “Billy!” before it
broke from my lips. Thank heaven also for that numbness all over me that allowed
me to say in a voice as detached as if it had been the piano-tuner to whom I’d
just opened the door, “Oh! good morning.”

“Good morning.” A tone as blank as a whitewashed wall between him and me. “I
suppose you are surprised to see me.”

“Well, I—yes, I am, of course.”

“You didn’t expect me.”

“No.” We both glanced down at my sleeves, still rolled up from the kitchen. “I
have something to say to you,” he went on in that same tone. His face I couldn’t
see in that little, dark drainpipe of a passage where we stood. “That’s why I
came.”

“Oh!”

What could it be that brought him an eight hours’ journey on my track? Surely
not that foolish old out-of-date apology still—or those unwanted thanks for
saving his life. “Don’t you want to hear what it is?”

“Er—yes; oh, yes,” reluctantly. “But I’m sorry I can’t ask you to sit down here;
you see my friend is away——”

“Oh! She’s _away_. I’m glad she’s well enough. I thought she was ill.”

This I didn’t know how to meet. “Where may I speak to you, then?” he added. “Is
it—about something very important?”

“Important enough to bring me up to London by the midnight train after you’d
left. I just had a bath and breakfast at an hotel and came on here. So—”

Evidently there was no getting out of it. —“Will you come out and talk? If it’s
not troubling you too much,” he added stonily. “Well, if you will wait until I
put on my hat and coat,” I said slowly, “I will come out into Battersea Park
with you. We can sit down there.”

In a few minutes we were sitting side by side on a couple of green-backed wooden
chairs on the path that faces the sluggish brown river and the barges that slid
slowly between us and the tower of Old Chelsea Church. Why had he come?
“Important,” he’d said. Was it a recall? Must I go back for the five remaining
months of my year’s contract? I remembered, then, that it was in writing—I’d
forgotten that! Must I return to Porth Cariad to serve the purpose of him and
that girl? If he insisted, I must. I should be glad—(not, not to be with _him_
again! That passing feeling I should no doubt manage to kill. I _must_ kill
it)—to be back with his mother and Blanche and Theo in that golden Anglesey,
instead of in this baked and dusty park, rowdy with Board-school children on
holiday. For the sake of the _place_ I could forget the man I was with; I could
ignore that morning when we painted the figure-head! Thank heaven I was feeling
so like “a wooden woman” myself. For another moment I was kept waiting,
wondering what he would say. Three words told me everything. They swept aside so
many things that up to then had seemed real and undeniable enough. They did away
with hours in a music-room, of another hour in the dusk under a copper-beech,
when overtures were made of a friendship that seemed as if it were going to work
all right, (“_You could be such a little brick to me!_”) but had broken down
because, after all, he was a man and I a girl—even though I didn’t happen to be
the right girl.... Those weeks of gay, open-air comradeship in Wales, that
morning of sunshine and hotly-snatched kisses on a cliff among the gorse, that
afternoon of a race and a struggle for life in the jade-green waters of a
bay.... All these were to be as though they’d never been. It was all over in
those three words:

“Now, Miss Trant!”

The unexpected sex? Oh, no! It’s we who can be trusted to do just what’s
expected of _us_ by our nearest man: to be heroic, petty, clinging or capable.
He meant me to be utterly business-like and formal. Well, he found me so, my
tone just matching his own. “Now, Miss Trant!”

“Yes, Mr. Waters?”

“It’s about this nominal engagement of ours. That was to go on for a year, I
think.”

“Yes.”

“You’ll be glad to hear it needn’t last so long, after all.”

“Not a year?”

“Not any longer at all. I’ve come to release you now.”

I found absolutely nothing to say. It was as if I’d been preparing to walk down
a long corridor that stretched before me, and had found, after I’d gone a yard,
that a door was slammed in my face. I seemed to stare at blank walls in every
other direction.... I’d better say something.... What was there? “Thank you for
letting me know.” Then, “As this has only lasted so much less than the time you
said, I will send back to you my cheque for——”

“You will do nothing of the kind, please,” curtly. “I made the arrangement. I
break it.”

“Yes, but that money——”

“I shall not take it, anyhow.”

“I shall send it somewhere, then,” I told him, and glanced round at the nearest
group of grimy little Cockneys on the brown grass. “The Fresh Air Fund.”

“As you please.”

A pause. I was wondering if he meant me to say anything else. He began again. “I
expect you guess my reason for this change of arrangement.”

“I think—I do,” I said. Yes, I thought, whatever it was that stood between him
and an open engagement to Mademoiselle Charrier must be at an end, and Miss
Trant, alias “Nancy,” is no longer needed for the rôle of the red herring on the
trail. But his next remark almost startled me out of my chair. “Ah! You mean you
quite realize that in breaking this contract, I’m considering _your_ feelings.
It is for _your_ sake.”

“_Mine?_”

“Naturally!” he said sharply. “When I saw that the arrangement had become so
irksome to you—when I saw _why_——”

I turned to stare up at his temper-set face, repeating “When?”

“Need you ask when? Last night,” he said, still more sharply, “at Holyhead
Station.”

Ah! Then he _had_ thought—what I’d wondered about. It was my turn to look set
with anger; I know I flushed. Let him go on. “Yesterday, first thing in the
morning, you get that wire, handed in at Euston. A message that’s
obviously—well, a fake. Didn’t you arrange to receive it?”

“Yes,” I admitted shortly. “I did.”

“Ah. I knew that, Miss Trant. Following on that, I find you travelling back to
London the very same evening with that—that friend of yours, Mr. Vandeleur.
Rather a coincidence.”

“You mean,” I said, my heart thumping with rage, partly against Cicely’s adorer
for making this trouble, partly against this other man with his savage tone and
suspicious eyes, “that you think I told him to send the wire!”

“There was the wire! And there _he_ was.”

“Even if it had been so, why not?”

“With you engaged to me?”

“Nominally!”

“Makes no difference to the circumstances!” he shot out. “Who knows that, but
you and I? To anyone else, it would have looked uncommonly——”

“I don’t see it!” I declared, but I saw the reason of his anger and it made me
angrier still. _His_ dignity compromised! His official dignity as a _fiancé_! So
I had heard of married men, with wives to whom they were utterly indifferent,
still showing that furious male jealousy of other men. “But I should have been
doing nothing against our contract.”

“Nothing against the letter of it, you think? But when I asked you to enter into
it, one of my first questions, you’ll remember, was whether you were already
engaged.”

“Well?”

“Well! I shouldn’t have troubled you if I’d known all this. I’m sorry.”

“Known all _what_?”

“Remember, it’s not the only time I’ve seen you with him!” he went off at a
tangent. “There was that first occasion—at the Carlton. I thought there seemed
something, when he congratulated me! And then that time at the flat. He had eyes
for nothing but you.”

“Oh, _hadn’t_ he!” I was breaking in, but my late employer went on with his
indictment. “Even Montresor, at our house, seemed to know all about it! And now
his meeting you in Wales—You won’t tell me that wasn’t by appointment?”

“I will,” I said, lifting my head. “I do, Mr. Waters. It wasn’t.”

He was silent for a moment. “Please take my word.”

“Of course, if you say so!” he agreed quickly. Then, more quickly still, “But if
he didn’t send that telegram, who did?”

“You saw it! It was signed.”

“Yes; by your friend Miss Harradine. That says nothing. You asked her to send
it—wired the night before, perhaps.... Didn’t you?” he cross-examined me.
“Didn’t you?”

“Well—if I did? Yes!”

“Why did you, Miss Trant?”

I looked away from him, mutinous but helpless, at the border of the path in
front, with its little clumps of heat-shrivelled purple pansies, drooping over
the powdery earth. There was something that no cross-examination should get out
of me! Let him know that I couldn’t bear to stay in the same place with
him—first, because he’d kissed me; next, because there was no reason that he
should ever kiss me again ... every reason that he would not? Never! “Why had
you to go?”

“Oh!” I cried, with a little stamp of my shoe on the gravel. “Why need you pry
into—into what’s my affair alone? Is even an _official fiancée_ allowed to keep
nothing to herself?”

“Very well,” he said savagely. Then, off at another tangent, “But at least you
won’t tell me that the fellow didn’t want to marry you himself?”

“What difference does it make if he did? That was ages ago, months!” I let out
hastily. “Anyhow—one’s not supposed to tell these things, but, as we’re talking
business, I may tell you as a business-secret that I refused him!”

“You did?”—quickly. “Was this before—before our arrangement was made?”

“N-no. Just afterwards.”

“Ah! You weren’t free, you thought. Otherwise——May I ask if you would have
accepted him?”

“You’ve no right to ask!”

“I know that,” he admitted angrily, “but have you—had you a right to make me
look foolish—about him?”

“I never have done that!” I snapped. “You believe me that last night was an
accident.”

“Yes,” he argued, “but you must confess that other things look rather
mysterious.”

“Mysterious? Need _you_ talk about things being mysterious,” I argued back,
“when the whole of what you wanted me for has been such a mystery to me? You’ve
never given me a hint of the reason!”

“I haven’t been able to! You were to have known later! But about this other——”

He broke off as a mild-looking old man plumped himself down on the green seat
next his, and began to scatter crumbs out of a paper-bag to the sooty sparrows
twittering on the path. “I can’t tell you, here——”

“I am rather deaf,” said the bird-feeder, mildly looking up, “and quite elderly.
Don’t mind me.”

Still Waters looked as if he could have choked him with his paper-bag. “We’ll
walk about a bit, if you don’t mind,” he said curtly to me. And it seems to me
now that for hours and hours we two walked Battersea Park, talking, talking,
still repeating ourselves over “_that wire_” and “_nothing to do with you_” and
“_yes, but I’d at least a right to object to your making me look_——” ... Round
the lake we went, up and down the path of the river front, on the broad bald
grass patches, passing communities of little motherly girls with perambulators
and picnic-bags in the shadow of the elms, skirting little boys’ cricket-matches
conducted with crooked bats, shrill yells—it was all noise and glare and dust
that morning, and I couldn’t really say why we should be walking up and down in
it like this, endlessly discussing what had no point, now.... Hadn’t we come,
long ago, to the end? At last he did raise a fresh point. “Anyhow,” he blurted
out, “I stand in your way no longer.”

This roused me beyond all the rest. “D’you mean,” I cried, exasperated, “in the
way of my possibly marrying Mr. Vandeleur?”

“Exactly!”

Was I to stand this? Was I to let him go away imagining _that_ was the sort of
girl I was? Was I to allow him, later on, to think of his official ex-_fiancée_
(if he ever thought of her again) as being quite contented to accept a dangling
_dilettante_ with those tastes and that tie, an indoor object who pottered
amiably about Art-galleries and girls’ studios, between the Tiny Theatre and the
Cave of the Cub, a pampered amateur who couldn’t earn his living to save his
life?... was a real man to think of me, married to That? No—fear! So I said,
very distinctly, “Even if his extremely easy attention _hadn’t_ been caught by
another girl—the girl he was seeing off to the Irish boat last night at
Holyhead, if you must know!—even if he were the only man left on board a—a
desert-island, I shouldn’t want to marry Sydney Vandeleur, so now you know!—And
you needn’t think, as men always _do_ think, that it’s sour grapes!” I rushed on
before he could put in a word. “You might ask my chum about that—the very
afternoon we had tea there I nearly offended her by letting her see what I
thought of _him_!—even though he still imagined himself in love with me——”

Here I broke off, for a flying cricket-ball from one of those shrieking teams we
passed had knocked off my companion’s straw hat. He had to pick it up and then
to sling the ball in back to the small and grimy bowler before he could speak;
and I, worked up to it now, didn’t see why he, the man, should be allowed the
passing of every vote of censure, so I went on:

“As for your accusing me of making you look foolish, Mr. Waters, what about you,
with me? What about the other girl? I was, after all, your official _fiancée_.
And—and in that capacity, I might just as well have objected to your paying so
much attention to _her_!”

“What’s this?” he took up very sharply, stopping on the path. “When have you
seen me with another girl?”

“Why! Yesterday! The day before, too!”

“_What——?_” he said, long drawn-out. “Can you mean—_can_ you mean the daughter
of Monsieur Charrier?”

(What did he imagine? Could I mean the figure-head of the _Gwladys Pritchard_?)
“Of course I mean Mademoiselle Cha——”

“Object to Odette Charrier?” he cried, almost as loudly as Theo might have done.
And, staring up at him, I saw that the set mask of his face had broken up into
its broadest, most boyish smile. His eyes were full of laughter and delight....

Ah! How she must hold him, I thought, for her very name so to irradiate him in a
moment! “_That_,” he said, with the laughter running through his voice,“was so
utterly different.”

“Ah, yes! It’s always ‘different’ in one’s own case. You and another girl can do
as you choose—but you wouldn’t have allowed an inch to me and another man—_you_
mustn’t be compromised. Well, you should know your own side of it. All that, I
suppose, is what you can’t tell _me_.”

“Exactly!” he said again, and all the smile went out of his face. “This _dashed_
tangle!”

“But considering it’s all at an end now,” I said reasonably enough, “why need we
go on talking about it?” And then I found that I was holding my breath in
suspense. Terrified suspense lest he should take me at my word.... I knew then.
I knew why I felt so. If we _could_ only “go on”! I asked for nothing more. More
clearly with each minute, these hours had been showing me one thing at least.
Whatever he chose to say, however he rated me, dictated to me what I should or
should not have done—to listen to his voice was pure joy. Just to be—in
Battersea, Anglesey, anywhere!—the sea itself, but _with him_, was like coming
out of a stifling tunnel into sunshine and air. He didn’t want me, but I was
helplessly his. A mere summer-holiday attraction? No, so much the worse for me.
_That_ wouldn’t have meant this sense that every thread of me was knit up and
together into one strand that drew me, tied me to him; and must be broken or
unravelled now; for neither broken nor unravelled threads are much more good for
working! A passing fancy? Not it; not this helpless enchantment that had been
growing and growing over me—for how long I didn’t know. It didn’t even allow me
to wish that I’d never known the man beside me except as Still Waters of the
Near Oriental, that I’d never seen him in his home, never listened to tones of
his voice unknown before, never realized what a perfect darling he could be,
this “real Billy,” or how it would be heaven to be made love to by him! His hand
up the cliff-path once or twice....

Three kisses ... three-and-a-half, if I count that Sevenoaks time, were all I
should have to think of for the rest of my life.... Wildly I thought that, if he
suggested it, I’d be humbly content to remain his official _fiancée_ for ever.
Only not to be sent away! Not to be cut off from the sight and sound of him! Not
left to a life that must be all echoes and shadows; desperate, threadbare
memories of everything he’d looked and said, every note of his songs, the very
gestures with which he’d feel in his coat-pocket for matches, each movement of
his lips and eyes! I had to keep my own eyes resolutely from his as we turned
away from the cycle-track, afraid that even he might notice. Presently he
stopped again. Already? I daren’t look at him. I looked down at his shadow on
the dusty road, a pool of black—the sun was high above us, time was getting on.
And I mustn’t show him how desperately I would have clutched it back if I could.
(Oh, to think of those other hours, days—a whole long week of them!—that I had
wasted in sulks, in “baiting” him, at The Lawn!) We were standing by one of the
bridges. Here, where I had once thrown away flowers of his—oh! how could I?—I
remembered something else that must come into our parting. A smaller thing, but
a more barbed one. Not to be shirked, though. “Your ring!” I said. I took it off
and handed it to him. It flashed its green and blue and orange sparks in the
sunlight as it lay in his palm. He looked at it, hard. No harder than I did. I
was looking my good-bye to something that had meant so little—and so much. Too
much. I didn’t know how I was going to bear another second of this; and then,
quickly, he closed his brown hand over his diamonds and dropped them into his
jacket-pocket. Gone. Then, looking eastward over the bridge, he said, “We’d a
discussion about this before.”

“Had we?” I said. I wondered what had become of my pride, so frantically was I
hoping that this might lead to another “discussion” now. Anything to keep him
for another few minutes.... That gesticulating _trèfle_-scented French beauty
would have him for the rest of her life; she might spare him to me for just one
more squabble! “Yes: don’t you remember how you informed me you’d send the ring
back at the year’s end? I said then——But look here!” he broke off, “isn’t there
anywhere near here where we could get some lunch while we settle about this?”

Ah! Then I should have my few minutes longer! *       *       *       *       *

There’s a little creamery in the King’s Road where he and I lunched together
again: this time off rolls and butter and boiled eggs. There he began again. “An
engaged girl who had been _really_ engaged,” he said, “would insist upon sending
back the ring as a matter of course; but why in this case?”

And so on. It was just because I was so afraid of seeming to linger, as I longed
to do, that I appeared to be in such haste to finish the meal that nearly choked
me, and to draw a glove over that ringless finger that felt, suddenly, so bare
and unfamiliar—and lonely. “You’ll have coffee, won’t you?”

“No, thanks.” Oh, why hadn’t I said, “Yes”? He’d lost that scowl, he seemed so
much nearer the old friendly terms again, and it was for the last time! “I will;
unless you’re in a hurry, Miss Trant? Just a moment—”

Yes! Just a moment! It was all I asked, that, and that my heart should not beat
so fast and make me feel so weak and dizzy. —“Here, boy!”—this was to a
newspaper-boy who was strolling past the shop behind a large pink poster and a
bundle of early evening editions. “D’you mind if I just look up something——”

The man opposite to me unfolded the still damp sheet; his eyes on the paper gave
mine the chance of one more direct, long, hungry look at his face. Then came
surprise on surprise. I saw his face change utterly, turn blank, agitated. An
odd-sounding “_Ah!_” broke from his lips. Then he looked up again alert,
decisive. He stuffed the paper into his pocket, paused one instant, frowning in
thought. Then counter-ordered the coffee. “No time for it,” he said. Then rose
to take his hat from the rack beside the little mirror. So soon? Oh, so soon?
What had brought this about? Why “no time”? It seemed scarcely a minute since
I’d opened the door of our flat to him, and now he was off! In this hurry! Why?
But that didn’t matter. What mattered was that, after all, I was a soldier’s
daughter: that it was expected of our family that they should show no sign of
being under fire, and that I’d got to go through what was coming without a
tremor or glance to betray the sick sinking of the heart within me; lightly and
steadily, holding myself well in hand. Afterwards I could get back to the
flat.... So, as one tells the dentist, “I’m ready—_now!_” before a wrench, I
picked my minute and was holding out my hand to him as he turned from the
waitress. I must say it first. “Well, good-bye, Mr. Waters!”

He didn’t seem to hear that. “Miss Trant, I find I’ve got to get down to the
City at once.”

“Oh, yes?” (It sounded all right, I think.) “Then here we part company.”

Sharply concise, in his old orders-for-the-day voice, came Still Waters’ “No. If
you don’t mind, I want you to come on with me.”

With him? And presently I was whizzing down King’s Road to Sloane Square in a
taxi beside him, wondering, as even he had never made me wonder yet, what this
further unexpectedness might mean. He said nothing. He was intent upon the paper
he had taken out again. Business, of course—but why take me with him? At the
post office he stopped the cab, got out and strode to the telephone, then out
again. “As quick as you can,” he told the driver, “to the Near Oriental Shipping
Company’s offices, Leadenhall Street.”

CHAPTER XXVIII

THE FIRST GLEAM

At the office, which to my experience seemed to belong to a previous existence,
but to my eyes seemed only of yesterday, every familiar object was in its place
and unchanged. The first of these was the figure of Mr. Dundonald. He confronted
us just outside the door of the Principal’s office, and after a bow to me which
a week ago would have made me long to shriek with amusement, came forward with
his most _affairé_ manner and said something, gravely and in a low voice, to his
chief. “I know. Can’t attend to it now. Presently!” the Governor put him aside,
but also seriously. “When Mr. Albert Waters comes in; I’ve ’phoned him. Send the
boy to me when I ring.”

Then he opened the door of his room. Here, too, all looked exactly as it had
done that afternoon four months and an eternity ago! The light and spaciousness
of it, the mile-walk stretch of deep red carpet, the round-topped mahogany clock
on the wide mantelshelf, that big desk, bare but for the turnover date ticket
upon it, his revolving chair in front of it, and that other plump green-morocco-
covered arm-chair that he had first pointed at, that afternoon, for me to take.
He pointed to it now. “Sit down, please.”

Down I sat, watching him as he turned to the desk. He was writing rapidly
telegraph-forms. Then his hand went out to the well-known row of electric bell-
pushes on his desk. One thing there, after all, was new: the extending bracket-
telephone. Ah, yes; he’d put that in his letter.... The equally well-known sharp
little Cockney face of Harold appeared at the door; the boy came up and took the
forms, which the Governor had gathered into two bundles. “These to go off at
once. These to be coded.”

“Yessir.”

I sat there wondering. If this business of his meant so much haste, why had he
made Mr. Dundonald wait for it? Above all, what had I to do with it that I
should be there at all? We were alone again. He glanced at the clock, then
wheeled round in his chair and faced me. He spoke with matter-of-fact
politeness. “Now, Miss Trant! I suppose you want to know what all this is about?
Not only my bringing you on here, but about the whole of our past arrangement?”

Did I want to know? After all, what did it matter to me now? For me, all had
been summed up in his dropping of my—of his name for me, and in the remembrance
of another girl’s laughing face. What stones would he give _her_ to wear? Not
diamonds.... I said nothing. “Shall I tell you,” he began again, “now?”

“Well, I don’t think any explanation was promised when you drew up that
contract,” I said wearily. “I don’t really mind ... you needn’t trouble.” ...

“I might _wish_ to clear it up,” he suggested. “Well, suppose we begin with
this.”

He handed over to me the newspaper which seemed to have hurled such a bomb at
him. I read the paragraph his finger marked as he passed it to me. END OF THE
FREIGHT WAR. _From our Hamburg Correspondent._

I am in a position to state that an arrangement has been     completed between
the interests represented by Messrs. Holmes,     Laing & Co., of Liverpool, and
a powerful combination of this     port, of which the Allgemeine——is chief. The
terms of the     compact are naturally secret, but it is believed that they
include a large setting apart of capital for the purpose of     carrying on the
recent freight war to lengths that no rival     combination can hope to equal.
Should such a combination     care to lease the river, it can ascertain to what
extent the     amalgamation is “bluffing.” From the point of view of exporters
generally, this will mean that the cheap rates that have     obtained during the
last two years to all ports of the Near     East will not last much longer. I
read it again. I was feeling much too tired and stupid to read newspapers—a
lengthy, fruitless and exhausting occupation at any time, I consider. “I’m
afraid,” I said forlornly, passing it back, “that this doesn’t convey very much
to me.”

He smiled, I thought as much as to say, “These _business_-girls!”

Then he said, “Well, but you’ve met this Monsieur Charrier, this big French
shipping man, in Anglesey? Perhaps you didn’t realize that I’d business reasons
for remaining on cordial terms—keeping in with him at all costs? Anyhow I may
tell you now that this was in view of the amalgamation which he and my firm
might be forming. I couldn’t, you understand, say anything before, but there was
to be an alliance——”

“Yes?” (Between himself and that Charrier girl. Why go on explaining it all to
me? I didn’t want to hear all this.) But he went on more quickly:

“You saw the sort of man he was. Touchy, excitable, easily put off! I had to be
always on my guard with him. So that when I heard that he—this important person
to me, Miss Trant—seemed inclined to do me the honour of selecting me, not only
as a business-ally, but also—”

He paused and looked at me. Of course I was attending, if that was what he
meant! —“also as a possible son-in-law, what was I to do?”

I said nothing. Of course he could do nothing but accept such a bride with
enthusiasm; but why apologize to _me_? “I realized,” he went on, “that I might
offend him to the verge of breaking off the other deal. I explained to you at
our first interview here that I’d _had_ no intention of getting married?”

(Had. Then he’d fallen in love with her later.) “Last Easter, which we spent at
Dinard with the Charriers,” he went on, “I—we all were on the most friendly
terms with Mademoiselle Charrier—”

I clenched my hands together; they were feeling, on that August afternoon, cold
as ice. —“And she was soon quite confidential to _me_,” continued the Governor.
“Told me lots of things about herself, just like a child—”

(A minx! That assumed frankness!) —“told me, even, of her own understanding with
a young airman who was over there then. A secret from her people—you know what
these French parents are—but I don’t suppose it’s a secret any longer now this
is all up.”

(Ah, no! Odette Charrier wouldn’t find it hard to jilt an airman or an
archangel—for him!) “It was she herself who told me, perfectly candidly, of her
father’s idea of the offer of her hand to me. You know that rum French way they
have—pretty awkward, that,” went on the Governor, beginning to speak almost as
rapidly as for that dictation he used to gabble off to me. “I was in a tight
corner then! There was the risk of turning a possible friend—and such a powerful
one!—into a certain enemy. I knew how offended he’d be by a refusal that _might_
seem due to reluctance! Then there was the young lady to consider—What’s the
matter, don’t you follow me?”

“No—I don’t understand,” I made myself say quite coherently, “what you mean by
‘refusal.’”

“Well, _she_ didn’t want to marry me! She’d got this aviator-chap. _I_ didn’t
want to marry anybody—then.”

(_Then._ Was he going to inflict upon me the whole of their love-story?) “And I
could only forestall the proposal she told me he meant to make by showing her
father some really tangible proof that I was out of the question. You see?”

“Yes,” I said slowly. “_I_ was—a nominal _fiancée_ was to be the tangible
proof.”

“Exactly. Well! Now comes the news that does away with that necessity. I’d been
expecting the corroboration of it for some days. However, it’s out at last;
here.” He tapped the paper. “It means that the alliance Waters-Charrier has been
knocked on the head; it means that my firm isn’t going to be quite the almighty
concern I hoped it might; but it also means that something—a big thing!—is saved
out of the fire: namely, that I needn’t take these drastic measures to avoid
Monsieur Charrier’s displeasure. If I don’t want to marry into his family, I can
say so if I choose.”

(_If—!_ He meant that _now_ Odette and he could show that theirs was nothing but
a love-match!) “And if I hadn’t broken off our nominal engagement this morning,
Miss Trant, I should be able to do it this afternoon; _now_.”

This meant that he was positively eager to get rid of me. Knife-thrust as it
was, I was glad to feel it. It spurred me for what I had to do, this time
without even being allowed to pick my minute; to rise, smile conventionally,
hold out my hand in farewell. He took it lightly, dropping it almost at once. In
a tone of unmistakable, undisguised relief he added, “So that’s the end of
_that_.”

“Yes!” I returned, quite casually enough to deceive a man, though it took my
last ounce of effort. “Good-bye!”

“Wait a minute. I said ‘the end of _that_,’” took up my late employer. “Now
here’s something that begins. Will you sit down again, please?”

The influence of the place we were in, I suppose, made me obey him. Again I sat
back in the green-leather chair, wondering if it made it better or worse to have
this leave-taking so dragged out, wondering why he chose this form of torture.
He came and stood above me. He began, quite gently, “I’ve taken your word that
that about Vandeleur was an accident, not an appointment. Well, then! If it
wasn’t on _his_ account that you had that wire sent to recall you, if it wasn’t
because of _him_ you bolted like that from me—from Anglesey,” he spoke more
emphatically, “_Why was it?_”

Again this cross-examination? What was I to say? I looked desperately about the
big room and its handsome fittings, at the side-table where I used to sit with
my notes. “_Why?_” he insisted. “Oh!” I cried angrily. “Does it matter?”

“Yes, it does. Why did you run away?”

I shook my head. He couldn’t _make_ me say....

“_Why?_” he repeated mercilessly. “Was it because of what occurred the morning
before that tussle of ours with the Bay, that time you were so reluctantly
compelled to save my life?”

“Oh, _yes!_ if you must bring that up again!” I threw at him, struggling to call
back the helpful, self-respecting anger which I’d been able to feel quite easily
then. “It’s all done with now, so——”

“So it _was_ because I kissed you.”

“_Well?_”

He stood looking at me. I couldn’t look at him, but I held my head up and stared
hard at a distant pale-green wall. “Are you—are you _surprised_ at that? Any
girl,” I forced myself to say, “would have been furious.”

“You mean,” quickly, “that any girl is furious when she’s kissed.”

“Oh, _I_ don’t know. I’m not thinking of other girls!”

“Any girl _I_ kissed, then?”

“No”—the Charrier girl’s face flashed before me, and a bitter little laugh
escaped me as I spoke—“oh, _no_.”

“You mean only yourself, then?”

“I suppose so, but——”

“_You_ objected, strenuously enough. Why?”

“‘_Why?_’—”

“Was it”—he was cross-examining me again—“because it was I who kissed you, or,”
he paused, “because it was a merely official lover who did so?”

I was caught; there was no direct answer I could make. “I hated it!” I cried
defensively. He varied the form, not the question. “It, or the circumstances?”

“Oh! Anything you like.”

“But which?” he persisted. “There’s a world of difference between the two. If
you please, Miss Trant—”

(How dared he use that authoritative tone for which I detested and adored him
so!) —“I want to know which it was?”

“Do you think I would stay”—I tried to fence—“after being treated like that? It
was”—I groped for a strong enough word—“infamous of you, Mr. Waters!”

“Of me?” he said. “It would have been equally so of any man?”

“Far worse of _you_!” I blurted out before I could recall it. “Why? Because I’d
no right?—But nor has any other man, apparently?” he added questioningly. “Oh,
_none_.”

“Then,” he said, and it sounded almost triumphant, “am _I_ so specially hateful
to you?”

“Yes.”

“_Yes?_” he caught up. “_No!_ Oh—” I felt myself shaking all over as I tried to
wriggle out of this corner into which he’d got me. What was he doing? Had he
guessed? Guessed that I cared? Then why drive it home?... It was worse than
cruelty ... it was—“anything you like, if you must go on like this.
Only—please—please _don’t_ ask—anything.” And I stopped on the sob that I could
only just keep back. “Ah,” he said slowly. Still I couldn’t look at him, but I
heard a change in his voice as he added, “Very well; what excuse do you expect
me to offer?”

“Excuse?” I flamed. I was too afraid I should break down in earnest and disgrace
myself. “There _is_ no excuse you can possibly make.”

“Isn’t there? There might be more than one, I think,” he said, quite gently
still. “I might put forward, for instance, that I’m only an ordinary man,
subject to temptation, and that you—if you’ll allow me to say so, Miss Trant—are
a very lovely girl.”

“Ah, no! Don’t!” I cried out, stung. “_Not_ that sort of thing.”

“Quite right,” he broke in promptly, but still quietly. A second’s pause, then—

“There _would_ be no excuse for snatching at you like that, Nancy, if there
weren’t a reason. And the reason, if you really haven’t guessed it, is, as it
happens——”

Once before, that day, three words from him had made a series of situations
crumble away and become as though they’d never been. Once again a whole set of
relations—that between a typist and the head of the firm; that between a paid
official _fiancée_ and her employer; that between a man and a girl who played
that drawn game of platonic friendship; that other between two who quarrelled
and fenced and misunderstood and hurt each other and themselves so cruelly—was
brushed aside by another three words. Billy Waters, still standing there and
looking down gravely at me, said very simply, “I love you.”

What could I say? I was too dazed. I gasped, as when at Porth Cariad I waded out
for a swim, and a racing wave met me and dashed above my breast, catching my
breath. Sentences formed themselves and died away before I opened my lips. “You
can’t mean——” “Then why——” “A mistake——” “This is the first gleam I’ve had that
you——” “If it’s because you’re _sorry_——” Then, of them all, I could catch
firmly at only one thought. I said breathlessly, holding the arm of the chair,
“_But that girl_——”

“Won’t you understand? I never gave her a thought of that sort, or she me,” he
declared rapidly, “except about how we were to get out of it. If you only knew,
that unfortunate French child and I had as much ado to keep from getting married
as some couples have to pull it off! I tell you she and that young Lenoir—man
who’s just beaten the record for upside-down flying—were—but it’s not _their_
affair I’m bothering about just now—it’s——”

“But she was so pretty!—so much smarter—she——”

“She was quicker than you! _She_ spotted, that day at tea in the cottage, how
her plan for me of an official _fiancée_ was working out.”

“_Her_ plan?” Even in that moment I remembered that the idea had never seemed
quite like him! “Yes—_I_ was at my wit’s end. _She_ told me the only plan was to
say I was already booked! Yes! But who to? ‘Anyone,’ she said. ‘You engage
someone—like a courier, an interpreter—someone you pay to understand it is a
farce’—(You know the way she talks!) ‘You go to an office—your own, perhaps. You
choose one of your stenographistes—you have of them, yes?’ I told her I’d got
four. I think I said three of the lot would be more or less impossible as a
_fiancée_, but the fourth—But never mind that.”

“Yes, but I do! What did you say about the fourth?”

“I’ll tell you,” he said, laughing a little, “some time. We have plenty of time,
I hope.”

“No, now,” I said. It _was_ my turn to insist. “What about the fourth?”

“Oh, I forget! Well, then,” hurriedly. “I believe I said she seemed quite a
nice, quiet, unassuming little mouse of a person—look here, you’ll _have_ to
forgive me if I do tell you!—not particularly brilliant at her job, but
dependable; and that perhaps she _was_ the kind of girl one could take about
when it seemed necessary, and leave a good deal to one’s people—mind, I’d
scarcely _seen_ you! I hadn’t seen you! I said I thought you seemed——”

“Well?”

“Well, perfectly _tractable_!”

He broke off to laugh again, and moved nearer to me. “A fortnight after that,
Nancy, you were defying me in my own den! That frock, and—_chucking_ my ring
about the piano! And now ...” he said, with a hand in his jacket-pocket, “now,
Miss Trant, I’m going to put that ring back, if I may, in its proper place.”

He would have taken my hand, but all in my flurry of delight I put them both
behind me. “No! Wait! Your people—what will they say to—all this?”

“But ... bless me! they know we’re engaged!”

“Yes, _that_ way,” I said shakily. “But _this_?”

“D’you suppose, Nancy-Monica Trant, that they’re ever going to know that there’s
any difference? D’you think ‘Theo will notice’ any? I doubt if they’d believe
that yarn if we told them! Very soon we shan’t believe it ourselves! So——Wait?
I’ve waited too long!”

But I was, all of a sudden, shy of him as I’d never been in my trembling typist
days. I put him back with a look. “_How_ long?” I asked falteringly. “Can’t you
tell me when?”

His face was full of protest, but he leaned, half-sitting, against the edge of
his desk. “What can I tell you?” he said. “That it was just now in Battersea
Park, seeing that the girl one can’t stop squabbling with is the girl one _has_
to make love to——”

“Yes, but really——”

“Or that it was mere gratitude to you for dragging me out of the water? Or—as
soon as I saw how disappointed my people would be if I ever let you go. (My
mother, last night! In tears—declaring it must be all _my_ temper!) Or
that—well, that as soon as I got you down to my home I began to wonder what on
earth I was thinking of, not to see that I kept you there.”

“No, but really——”

“Hang it all, Nancy, after all these weeks and months!” he cried, gaily
impatient, throwing back his handsome fair head. Could I ever have thought he
wasn’t handsome? He strode up to me, sat sideways on the green-leather arm of my
chair, put his hand in front of me on the other arm, and so faced me. It brought
his eyes, gay with laughter and delight, nearer than they had ever been, except
once, to my face. And I felt those eyes of his flash swiftly, from the ripple of
hair over my ear to the hot scarlet wave that I knew was dyeing my cheek, then
to my mouth. And it was as though I had felt his lips first here, then there,
and then there again, even before he drew closer yet and kissed me as though he
could not stop. But I pulled away. “Oh, Billy! No! _Please!_” I heard myself
sob. “I can’t bear it. Not—not all at once. Not so _much_——”

“Little _miser_!” he muttered, and took my hands down to clasp behind his neck.
“Am I _never_ to be allowed anything——”

“But I thought——”

“How _could_ you?” he whispered. “Haven’t you _eyes_?... Dashing away from me
like that, before I could get in a word! You spitfire! ‘Don’t speak to me,’ at
every turn! And that first time, I was only given a scrap of your hair to kiss!”

“S-sorry you don’t like my hair——”

“Not like it?” He pressed his cheek to it. “Not all that lovely soft stuff that
I always wanted to touch?—and mightn’t—not even that time after it came loose in
the water—”

“Looking _horrid_!”

—“and clung all down you! D’you know what I shall do to it, presently?”

I didn’t speak; I shut my eyes against his shoulder, and sighed.... And I had
once thought I was not the “falling-in-love-type” of girl! I had once called him
“that frozen ogre!”

“I shall twist this hair of yours into a great rope of black silk,” he said,
“and haul you off by it to that cave! Only question is, how soon? Nancy! How
soon?”

“A cave?” I said, half hearing, with my mouth against the cloth of his sleeve,
“what d’you mean?”

“Why, the sort of cave with a rose-garden to it, and perhaps a little white
wicket-gate at the top of the stairs—don’t you remember?”

But we’d certainly forgotten the author of that long-ago _contretemps_ at the
breakfast-table of The Lawn, the elderly _enfant terrible_ of that age-old week-
end! Our heads were close together over the date-ticket that the head of the
firm had grabbed from his desk to reckon up “how soon it could possibly be,” my
finger with the ring on it was caught between his lips, when the briefest of
taps at the door was followed by the most sudden of entrances—by Uncle Albert
Waters. “Ah!” he began, “what’s to be done now?” His rosy, John Bull face was
unrecognizably worried, but it suddenly lighted up. “What, the little girl too?”

I had sprung away—I hope!—before he could have noticed that there, in that most
official-looking of offices, I had been sitting on his nephew’s knee; but I was
still so fluttered that I could think of nothing to do but offer the old
gentleman my cheek! At all events, _he_ was absurdly pleased. “_Nancy_, my
dear!... But what brought _you_ back to London?”

“Furnishing,” said Billy, without a quiver. “Glad to hear it, my boy! First bit
of good news to-day,” said Mr. Waters, turning grave again. “I say, Billy! About
this——”

“I’m going,” I said quickly, picking my hat up from the side-table where it had
been tossed down as upon a gorse-bush. “I only meant to stay a minute.”

“_Nancy_—I say!” came resentfully from the desk. “I’ll be in the waiting-room,
then,” I promised. “Or, if I may, I’ll go and look up Miss Robinson and the
girls while you talk over your business.”

I don’t know why, exactly. Only I felt I must see those three girls again with
this new look on my face. They might not know the difference! Still—I walked to
the door. “Sensible little woman, this of yours, William,” his uncle trumpeted
approvingly, holding it open for me. “Knows there’s a time for everything....
All to yourself for good, presently; _that’s_ been official for months now.
Don’t you glower at me, lad, I saw you——”

The door shut behind me. But through it I heard Uncle Albert’s robustious: “Why!
Bless my life! Anyone would think I’d interrupted you before you’d been engaged
five minutes!”

POSTSCRIPT

FULL MOON

“This,” said Billy, taking in a full breath of the sea-scented air of Porth
Cariad, “is better than your old idea of a Riviera honeymoon, Nancy!”

We had just walked down from the larger of the cottages towards the shore, and
were watching that great primrose-coloured Chinese lantern of a moon rise
slowly, slowly over the jagged, purple silhouette of the Carnarvonshire
mountains into the pale mauve September dusk. Presently it would cast a
glittering path of light across the Bay of Many Waters, and throw a black shadow
from the cliff of the wooden woman on to the sands of our cove. There was a soft
lap-lapping of the high tide beneath us, and a softer scurrying of rabbits among
the sand-hills; now and again a gull called, or we caught the distant shouts of
the men in the fishing-boats putting out for the night. Beyond these small
sounds there was a great and brooding Peace; we were two hundred miles and more
from the noise and sunshine and merriment of the morning, from the great green
lawn sown with all the colour and movement of the wedding-party, living
confetti!—from the white house, echoing with laughter, and voices—Theo’s above
the rest—calling far after us: “Good luck! Good luck!”

“And are you glad to be back here, with me, to-night?”

“To-morrow,” I said dreamily, “we’ll go everywhere where we used to go——”

“Over to that cliff, Nancy——”

“Yes, and finish painting that figure-head——”

“Yes, or _not_ finish painting her. We’ve wasted too much good time at Port
Sweetheart as it is!”

But I felt that all our time here had all been so lovely—all! And now, this cool
white radiance was bathing the place in a light more magical than any day I had
seen. It made of it one of those dream-countries one walks in, half-waking, as a
child: a wide and lonely, lovely land; secret, too! of which one would not give
the entrance to one’s very dearest; a land I had scarcely dreamed of since I was
a half-grown girl. Why did those dreams come back to me now? I stared out to
sea; I didn’t want to move or speak; just to be there, watching that moonlight
on those waves, was enough. I was as still as that image of that other girl,
high up on the cliff....

At that moment I felt ... not myself at all, but outside myself and part of it
all—of the quivering, whispering sea under that chill and silver light, of those
fairy hills, of the sighing, cool air, and of the dewy earth. There was
something of all these in my own being—something of mine in all of them. For
that one moment I had forgotten the lover beside me; for just that last rapt
moment he was nothing to me....

Then he spoke. “The lights on the boats down there ... like glow-worms! Only
those are putting out to sea. And a glow-worm lights up—did you know why? to
guide its mate home.”

I sighed; slowly, slowly growing back again, out of the inhuman white glamour
and that silver distance....

“Are there,” I asked, a little absently, “any glow-worms in this place?”

“Further inland, perhaps,” he said. Very gently, he drew me round to face the
cottages. A warmer, dimmer, rosier light streamed through the door of the
kitchen, where we caught the pinky round globe of the lamp, the gleam of the
white cloth, the small, dark, cosy shape of Mrs. Roberts moving to and fro,
setting, with a little chinking of plates and forks, our supper. She came to the
door and called in her insidious voice, “_Mae’n barod rwan, sir!_”

“That means it’s ready now,” said Billy softly. “Come in, dear. Yes—those lights
are outward-bound, Nancy. But you—you’re anchored, aren’t you? All fast?”

“Ah, but as I love to be,” I said, this time with a happy sigh; and turned—to
his breast. He clasped me, crushing against my neck a kiss that has left there,
rosy and distinct, the impression of a chain....

It’s that slender gold chain which holds the little oval pendant framing a
christening-curl. His mother fastened that gift beneath the white shimmer of my
bridal-gown this morning. And I remember something that she said when first she
offered it. Presently, I shall tell my husband what it was. THE END
