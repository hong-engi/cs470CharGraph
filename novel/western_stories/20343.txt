I

THERE was an episode in the life of Paul Clitheroe that may possibly throw some little light upon the mystery of his taking off; and in connection with this matter it is perhaps worth detailing.
One morning Paul found a drop-letter in the mail which greeted him daily.
It ran as follows:

DEAR OLD BOY:

Don't forget the reception tomorrow.
Some one will be here whom I      wish you to know.
Most affectionately,

HARRY ENGLISH.
The "tomorrow" referred to was the very day on which Paul received the sweet reminder.
The reception of the message somewhat disturbed his customary routine.
To be sure, he glanced through the morning journal as usual; repaired to the Greek chop-house with the dingy green walls, the smoked ceiling, the glass partition that separated the guests from a kitchen lined with shining copper pans, where a cook in a white paper cap wafted himself about in clouds of vapor, lit by occasional flashes of light and ever curling flames, like a soul expiating its sins in a prescribed but savory purgatory.
He sat in his chosen seat, ignored his neighbors with his customary nonchalance, and returned to his room, as if nothing were about to happen.
But he accomplished little, for he felt that the day was not wholly his; so slight a cause seemed to change the whole current of his life from hour to hour.
In due season Paul entered a street car which ran to the extreme limit of San Francisco.
Harry English lived not far from the terminus, and to the cozy home of this most genial and hospitable gentleman the youth wended his way.
The house stood upon the steep slope of a hill; the parlor was upon a level with the street,--a basement dining-room below it,--but the rear of the house was quite in the air and all of the rear windows commanded a magnificent view of the North Bay with its islands and the opposite mountainous shore.
"Infinite riches in a little room," was the expression which came involuntarily to Paul's lips the first time he crossed the threshold of Thespian Lodge.
He might have said it of the Lodge any day in the week; the atmosphere was always balmy and soothing; one could sit there without talking or caring to talk; even without realizing that one was not talking and not being talked to; the silence was never ominous; it was a wholesome and restful home, where Paul was ever welcome and whither he often fled for refreshment.
The walls of the whole house were crowded with pictures, framed photographs and autographs, chiefly of theatrical celebrities; both "Harry," as the world familiarly called him, and his wife, were members of the dramatic profession and in their time had played many parts in almost as many lands and latitudes.
There was one chamber in this delightful home devoted exclusively to the pleasures of entomology, and there the head of the house passed most of the hours which he was free to spend apart from the duties of his profession.
He was a man of inexhaustible resources, consummate energy, and unflagging industry, yet one who was never in the least hurried or flurried; and he was Paul's truest and most judicious friend.
The small parlor at the Englishes was nearly filled with guests when Paul Clitheroe arrived upon the scene.
These guests were not sitting against the wall talking at each other; the room looked as if it were set for a scene in a modern society comedy.
In the bay window, a bower of verdure, an extremely slender and diminutive lady was discoursing eloquently with the superabundant gesticulation of the successful society amateur; she was dilating upon the latest production of a minor poet whose bubble reputation was at that moment resplendent with local rainbows.
Her chief listener was a languid beauty of literary aspirations, who, in a striking pose, was fit audience for the little lady as she frothed over with delightful, if not contagious, enthusiasm.
Mrs. English, who had been a famous belle--no one who knew her now would for a moment question the fact--devoted herself to the entertainment of a group of silent people, people of the sort that are not only colorless, but seem to dissipate the color in their immediate vicinity.
The world is full of such; they spring up, unaccountably, in locations where they appear to the least advantage.
Many a clever person who would delight to adorn a circle he longs to enter, and where he would be hailed with joy, through modesty, hesitates to enter it; while others, who are of no avail in any wise whatever, walk bravely in and find themselves secure through a quiet system of polite insistence.
Among the latter, the kind of people to be merely tolerated, we find, also, the large majority.
Two children remarkably self-possessed seized upon Paul the moment he entered the room: a beautiful lad as gentle and as graceful as a girl, and his tiny sister, who bore herself with the dignity of a little lady of Lilliput.
He was happy with them, quite as happy as if they were as old and experienced as their elders and as well entertained by them, likewise.
He never in his life made the mistake that is, alas, made by most parents and guardians, of treating children as if they were little simpletons who can be easily deceived.
How often they look with scorn upon their elders who are playing the hypocrite to eyes which are, for the most part, singularly critical!
Having paid his respects to those present--he was known to all--Paul was led a willing captive into the chamber where Harry English and a brother professional, an eccentric comedian, who apparently never uttered a line which he had not learned out of a play-book, were examining with genuine enthusiasm certain cases of brilliantly tinted butterflies.
The children were quite at their ease in this house, and no wonder; California children are born philosophers; to them the marvels of the somewhat celebrated entomological collection were quite familiar; again and again they had studied the peculiarities of the most rare and beautiful specimens of insect life under the loving tutelage of their friend, who had spent his life and a small fortune in gathering together his treasures, and they were even able to explain in the prettiest fashion the origin and use of the many curious objects that were distributed about the rooms.
Meanwhile Mme.
Lillian, the dramatic one, had left her bower in the bay window and was flitting to and fro in nervous delight; she had much to say and it was always worth listening to.
With available opportunities she would have long since become famous and probably a leader of her sex; but it was her fate to coach those of meaner capacities who were ultimately to win fame and fortune while she toiled on, in genteel poverty, to the end of her weary days.
No two women could be more unlike than this many-summered butterfly, as she hovered among her friends, and a certain comedy queen who was posing and making a picture of herself; the latter was regarded by the society-privates, who haunted with fearful delight the receptions at Thespian Lodge, with the awe that inspired so many inexperienced people who look upon members of the dramatic profession as creatures of another and not a better world, and considerably lower than the angels.
Two hours passed swiftly by; nothing ever jarred upon the guests in this house; the perfect suavity of the host and hostess forbade anything like antagonism among their friends; and though such dissimilar elements might never again harmonize, they were tranquil for the time at least.
The adieus were being said in the chamber of entomology, which was somewhat overcrowded and faintly impregnated with the odor of _corrosive sublimate_.
From the windows overlooking the bay there was visible the expanse of purple water and the tawny, sunburnt hills beyond, while pale-blue misty mountains marked the horizon with an undulating outline.
A ship under full sail--a glorious and inspiring sight--was bearing down before the stiff westerly breeze.
Mme.
Lillian made an apt quotation which terminated with a Delsartean gesture and a rising inflection that seemed to exact something from somebody; the comedienne struck one of her property attitudes, so irresistibly comic that every one applauded, and Mme.
Lillian laughed herself to tears; then they all drifted toward the door.
As mankind in general has much of the sheep in him, one guest having got as far as the threshold, the others followed; Paul was left alone with the Englishes and those clever youngsters, whose coachman, accustomed to waiting indefinitely at the Lodge, was dutifully dozing on the box seat.
The children began to romp immediately upon the departure of the last guest, and during the riotous half-hour that succeeded, there was a fresh arrival.
The door-bell rang; Mrs. English, who was close at hand, turned to answer it and at once bubbled over with unaffected delight.
Harry, still having his defunct legions in solemn review, recognized a cheery, un-American voice, and cried, "There she is at last!"
as he hastened to meet the newcomer.
Paul was called to the parlor where a young lady of the ultra-blonde type stood with a faultlessly gloved hand in the hand of each of her friends; she was radiant with life and health.
Of all the young ladies Paul could at that moment remember having seen, she was the most exquisitely clad; the folds of her gown fell about her form like the drapery of a statue; he was fascinated from the first moment of their meeting.
He noticed that nothing about her was ever disarranged; neither was there anything superfluous or artificial, in manner or dress.
She was in his opinion an entirely artistic creation.
She met him with a perfectly frank smile, as if she were an old friend suddenly discovering herself to him, and when Harry English had placed the hand of this delightful person in one of Paul's she at once withdrew the other, which Mrs. English fondly held, and struck it in a hearty half-boyish manner upon their clasped hands, saying, "Awfully glad to see you, Paul!"
and she evidently meant it.
This was Miss.
Juno, an American girl bred in Europe, now, after years of absence, passing a season in her native land.
Her parents, who had taken a country home in one of the California valleys, found in their only child all that was desirable in life.
This was not to be wondered at; it may be said of her in the theatrical parlance that she "filled the stage."
When Miss.
Juno dawned upon the scene the children grew grave, and, after a little delay, having taken formal leave of the company, they entered their carriage and were rapidly driven homeward.
If Paul and Miss.
Juno had been formed for one another and were now, at the right moment and under the most favorable auspices, brought together for the first time, they could not have mated more naturally.
If Miss.
Juno had been a young man, instead of a very charming woman, she would of course have been Paul's chum.
If Paul had been a young woman--some of his friends thought he had narrowly escaped it and did not hesitate to say so--he would instinctively have become her confidante.
As it was, they promptly entered into a sympathetic friendship which seemed to have been without beginning and was apparently to be without end.
They began to talk of the same things at the same moment, often uttering the very same words and then turned to one another with little shouts of unembarrassed laughter.
They agreed upon all points, and aroused each other to a ridiculous pitch of enthusiasm over nothing in particular.
Harry English beamed; there was evidently nothing wanted to complete his happiness.
Mrs. English, her eyes fairly dancing with delight, could only exclaim at intervals, "Bless the boy!"
or, "What a pair of children!"
then fondly pass her arm about the waist of Miss.
Juno--which was not waspish in girth--or rest her hand upon Paul's shoulder with a show of maternal affection peculiarly grateful to him.
It was with difficulty the half-dazed young fellow could keep apart from Miss.
Juno.
If he found she had wandered into the next room, while he was engaged for a moment, he followed at his earliest convenience, and when their eyes met they smiled responsively without knowing why, and indeed not caring in the least to know.
They were as ingenuous as two children in their liking for one another; their trust in each other would have done credit to the Babes in the Wood.
What Paul realized, without any preliminary analysis of his mind or heart, was that he wanted to be near her, very near her; and that he was miserable when this was not the case.
If she was out of his sight for a moment the virtue seemed to have gone from him and he fell into the pathetic melancholy which he enjoyed in the days when he wrote a great deal of indifferent verse, and was burdened with the conviction that his mission in life was to make rhymes without end.
In those days, he had acquired the habit of pitying himself.
The emotional middle-aged woman is apt to encourage the romantic young man in pitying himself; it is a grewsome habit, and stands sturdily in the way of all manly effort.
Paul had outgrown it to a degree, but there is nothing easier in life than a relapse--perhaps nothing so natural, yet often so unexpected.
Too soon the friends who had driven Miss.
Juno to Thespian Lodge and passed on--being unacquainted with the Englishes--called to carry her away with them.
She was shortly--in a day or two in fact--to rejoin her parents, and she did not hesitate to invite Paul to pay them a visit.
This he assured her he would do with pleasure, and secretly vowed that nothing on earth should prevent him.
They shook hands cordially at parting, and were still smiling their baby smiles in each other's faces when they did it.
Paul leaned against the door-jamb, while the genial Harry and his wife followed his new-found friend to the carriage, where they were duly presented to its occupants--said occupants promising to place Thespian Lodge upon their list.
As the carriage whirled away, Miss.
Juno waved that exquisitely gloved hand from the window and Paul's heart beat high; somehow he felt as if he had never been quite so happy.
And this going away struck him as being a rather cruel piece of business.
To tell the whole truth, he couldn't understand why she should go at all.
He felt it more and more, as he sat at dinner with his old friends, the Englishes, and ate with less relish than common the delicious Yorkshire pudding and drank the musty ale.
He felt it as he accompanied his friends to the theater, where he sat with Mrs. English, while she watched with pride the husband whose impersonations she was never weary of witnessing; but Paul seemed to see him without recognizing him, and even the familiar voice sounded unfamiliar, or like a voice in a dream.
He felt it more and more when good Mrs. English gave him a nudge toward the end of the evening and called him "a stupid," half in sport and half in earnest; and when he had delivered that excellent woman into the care of her liege lord and had seen them securely packed into the horse-car that was to drag them tediously homeward in company with a great multitude of suffocating fellow-sufferers, he felt it; and all the way out the dark street and up the hill that ran, or seemed to run, into outer darkness--where his home was--he felt as if he had never been the man he was until now, and that it was all for _her_ sake and through _her_ influence that this sudden and unexpected transformation had come to pass.
And it seemed to him that if he were not to see her again, very soon, his life would be rendered valueless; and that only to see her were worth all the honor and glory that he had ever aspired to in his wildest dreams; and that to be near her always and to feel that he were much--nay, everything--to her, as before God he felt that at that moment she was to him, would make his life one long Elysium, and to death would add a thousand stings.

Saadi had no hand in it, yet all Persia could not outdo it.
The whole valley ran to roses.
They covered the earth; they fell from lofty trellises in fragrant cataracts; they played over the rustic arbors like fountains of color and perfume; they clambered to the cottage roof and scattered their bright petals in showers upon the grass.
They were of every tint and texture; of high and low degree, modest or haughty as the case might be--but roses all of them, and such roses as California alone can boast.
And some were fat or _passe_, and more's the pity, but all were fragrant, and the name of that sweet vale was Santa Rosa.
Paul was in the garden with Miss.
Juno.
He had followed her thither with what speed he dared.
She had expected him; there was not breathing-space for conventionality between these two.
In one part of the garden sat an artist at his easel; by his side a lady somewhat his senior, but of the type of face and figure that never really grows old, or looks it.
She was embroidering flowers from nature, tinting them to the life, and rivaling her companion in artistic effects.
These were the parents of Miss.
Juno--or rather not quite that.
Her mother had been twice married; first, a marriage of convenience darkened the earlier years of her life; Miss.
Juno was the only reward for an age of domestic misery.
A clergyman joined these parties--God had nothing to do with the compact; it would seem that he seldom has.
A separation very naturally and very properly followed in the course of time; a young child was the only possible excuse for the delay of the divorce.
Thus are the sins of the fathers visited upon the grandchildren.
Then came a marriage of love.
The artist who having found his ideal had never known a moment's weariness, save when he was parted from her side.
Their union was perfect; God had joined them.
The stepfather to Miss.
Juno had always been like a big brother to her--even as her mother had always seemed like an elder sister.
Oh, what a trio was that, my countrymen, where liberty, fraternity and equality joined hands without howling about it and making themselves a nuisance in the nostrils of their neighbors!
Miss.
Juno stood in a rose-arbor and pointed to the artists at their work.
"Did you ever see anything like that, Paul?"
"Like what?"
"Like those sweet simpletons yonder.
They have for years been quite oblivious of the world about them.
Thrones might topple, empires rise and fall, it would matter nothing to them so long as their garden bloomed, and the birds nested and sung, and he sold a picture once in an age that the larder might not go bare."
"I've seen something like it, Miss.
Juno.
I've seen fellows who never bothered themselves about the affairs of others,--who, in short, minded their own business strictly--and they got credit for being selfish."
"Were they happy?"
"Yes, in their way.
Probably their way wasn't my way, and their kind of happiness would bore me to death.
You know happiness really can't be passed around, like bon-bons or sherbet, for every one to taste.
I hate bon-bons: do you like them?"
"That depends upon the quality and flavor--and--perhaps somewhat upon who offers them.
I never buy bon-bons for my private and personal pleasure.
Do any of you fellows really care for bon-bons?"
"That depends upon the kind of happiness we are in quest of; I mean the quality and flavor of the girl we are going to give them to."
"Have girls a flavor?"
"Some of them have--perhaps most of them haven't; neither have they form nor feature, nor tint nor texture, nor anything that appeals to a fellow of taste and sentiment."
"I'm sorry for these girls of yours----"

"You needn't be sorry for the girls; they are not my girls, and not one of them ever will be mine if I can help it----"

"Oh, indeed!"
"They are nothing to me, and I'm nothing to them; but they are just--they are just the formless sort of thing that a formless sort of fellow always marries; they help to fill up the world, you know."
"Yes, they help to fill a world that is overfull already.
Poor Mama and Eugene don't know how full it is.
When Gene wants to sell a picture and can't, he thinks it's a desert island."
"Probably they could live on a desert island and be perfectly happy and content," said Paul.
"Of course they could; the only trouble would be that unless some one called them at the proper hours they'd forget to eat--and some day they'd be found dead locked in their last embrace."
"How jolly!"
"Oh, very jolly for very young lovers; they are usually such fools!"
"And yet, I believe I'd like to be a fool for love's sake, Miss.
Juno."
"Oh, Paul, you are one for your own,--at least I'll think so, if you work yourself into this silly vein!"
Paul was silent and thoughtful.
After a pause she continued.
"The trouble with you is, you fancy yourself in love with every new girl you meet--at least with the latest one, if she is at all out of the ordinary line."
"The trouble with me is that I don't keep on loving the same girl long enough to come to the happy climax--if the climax _is_ to be a happy one; of course it doesn't follow that it is to be anything of the sort.
I've been brought up in the bosom of too many families to believe in the lasting quality of love.
Yet they are happy, you say, those two gentle people perpetuating spring on canvas and cambric.
See, there is a small cloud of butterflies hovering about them--one of them is panting in fairy-like ecstasy on the poppy that decorates your Mama's hat!"
Paul rolled a cigarette and offered it to Miss.
Juno, in a mild spirit of bravado.
To his delight she accepted it, as if it were the most natural thing in the world for a girl to do.
He rolled another and they sat down together in the arbor full of contentment.
"Have you never been in love?"
asked Paul suddenly.
"Yes, I suppose so.
I was engaged once; you know girls instinctively engage themselves to some one whom they fancy; they imagine themselves in love, and it is a pleasant fallacy.
My engagement might have gone on forever, if he had contented himself with a mere engagement.
He was a young army officer stationed miles and miles away.
We wrote volumes of letters to each other--and they were clever letters; it was rather like a seaside novelette, our love affair.
He was lonely, or restless, or something, and pressed his case.
Then Mama and Gene--those ideal lovers--put their feet down and would none of it."
"And you?"
"Of course I felt perfectly wretched for a whole week, and imagined myself cruelly abused.
You see he was a foreigner, without money; he was heir to a title, but that would have brought him no advantages in the household."
"You recovered.
What became of him?"
"I never learned.
He seemed to fade away into thin air.
I fear I was not very much in love."
"I wonder if all girls are like you--if they forget so easily?"
"You have yourself declared that the majority have neither form nor feature; perhaps they have no feeling.
How do men feel about a broken engagement?"
"I can only speak for myself.
There was a time when I felt that marriage was the inevitable fate of all respectable people.
Some one wanted me to marry a certain some one else.
I didn't seem to care much about it; but my friend was one of those natural-born match-makers; she talked the young lady up to me in such a shape that I almost fancied myself in love and actually began to feel that I'd be doing her an injustice if I permitted her to go on loving and longing for the rest of her days.
So one day I wrote her a proposal; it was the kind of proposal one might decline without injuring a fellow's feelings in the least--and she did it!"
After a thoughtful pause he continued:

"By Jove!
But wasn't I immensely relieved when her letter came; such a nice, dear, good letter it was, too, in which she assured me there had evidently been a mistake somewhere, and nothing had been further from her thoughts than the hope of marrying me.
So she let me down most beautifully----"

"And offered to be a sister to you?"
"Perhaps; I don't remember now; I always felt embarrassed after that when her name was mentioned.
I couldn't help thinking what an infernal ass I'd made of myself."
"It was all the fault of your friend."
"Of course it was; I'd never have dreamed of proposing to her if I hadn't been put up to it by the match-maker.
Oh, what a lot of miserable marriages are brought on in just this way!
You see when I like a girl ever so much, I seem to like her too well to marry her.
I think it would be mean of me to marry her."
"Why?"
"Because--because I'd get tired after a while; everybody does, sooner or later,--everybody save your Mama and Eugene,--and then I'd say something or do something I ought not to say or do, and I'd hate myself for it; or she'd say something or do something that would make me hate her.
We might, of course, get over it and be very nice to one another; but we could never be quite the same again.
Wounds leave scars, and you can't forget a scar--can you?"
"You may scar too easily!"
"I suppose I do, and that is the very best reason why I should avoid the occasion of one."
"So you have resolved never to marry?"
"Oh, I've resolved it a thousand times, and yet, somehow, I'm forever meeting some one a little out of the common; some one who takes me by storm, as it were; some one who seems to me a kind of revelation, and then I feel as if I must marry her whether or no; sometimes I fear I shall wake up and find myself married in spite of myself--wouldn't that be frightful?"
"Frightful indeed--and then you'd have to get used to it, just as most married people get used to it in the course of time.
You know it's a very matter-of-fact world we live in, and it takes very matter-of-fact people to keep it in good running order."
"Yes.
But for these drudges, these hewers of wood and drawers of water, that ideal pair yonder could not go on painting and embroidering things of beauty with nothing but the butterflies to bother them."
"Butterflies don't bother; they open new vistas of beauty, and they set examples that it would do the world good to follow; the butterfly says, 'my mission is to be brilliant and jolly and to take no thought of the morrow.'"
"It's the thought of the morrow, Miss.
Juno, that spoils today for me,--that morrow--who is going to pay the rent of it?
Who is going to keep it in food and clothes?"
"Paul, you have already lived and loved, where there is no rent to pay and where the clothing worn is not worth mentioning; as for the food and the drink in that delectable land, nature provides them both.
I don't see why you need to take thought of the morrow; all you have to do is to take passage for some South Sea Island, and let the world go by."
"But the price of the ticket, my friend; where is that to come from?
To be sure I'm only a bachelor, and have none but myself to consider.
What would I do if I had a wife and family to provide for?"
"You'd do as most other fellows in the same predicament do; you'd provide for them as well as you could; and if that wasn't sufficient, you'd desert them, or blow your brains out and leave them to provide for themselves."
"An old bachelor is a rather comfortable old party.
I'm satisfied with my manifest destiny; but I'm rather sorry for old maids--aren't you?"
"That depends; of course everything in life depends; some of the most beautiful, the most blessed, the most bountifully happy women I have ever known were old maids; I propose to be one myself--if I live long enough!"
After an interlude, during which the bees boomed among the honey-blossoms, the birds caroled on the boughs, and the two artists laughed softly as they chatted at their delightful work, Paul resumed:

"Do you know, Miss.
Juno, this anti-climax strikes me as being exceedingly funny?
When I met you the other day, I felt as if I'd met my fate.
I know well enough that I'd felt that way often before, and promptly recovered from the attack.
I certainly never felt it in the same degree until I came face to face with you.
I was never quite so fairly and squarely face to face with any one before.
I came here because I could not help myself.
I simply had to come, and to come at once.
I was resolved to propose to you and to marry you without a cent, if you'd let me.
I didn't expect that you'd let me, but I felt it my duty to find out.
I'm dead sure that I was very much in love with you--and I am now; but somehow it isn't that spoony sort of love that makes a man unwholesome and sometimes drives him to drink or to suicide.
I suppose I love you too well to want to marry you; but God knows how glad I am that we have met, and I hope that we shall never really part again."
"Paul!"--Miss.
Juno's rather too pallid cheeks were slightly tinged with rose; she seemed more than ever to belong to that fair garden, to have become a part of it, in fact;--"Paul," said she, earnestly enough, "you're an awfully good fellow, and I like you so much; I shall always like you; but if you had been fool enough to propose to me I should have despised you.
Shake!"
And she extended a most shapely hand that clasped his warmly and firmly.
While he still held it without restraint, he added:

"Why I like you so much is because you are unlike other girls; that is to say, you're perfectly natural."
"Most people who think me unlike other girls, think me unnatural for that reason.
It is hard to be natural, isn't it?"
"Why, no, I think it is the easiest thing in the world to be natural.
I'm as natural as I can be, or as anybody can be."
"And yet I've heard you pronounced a bundle of affectations."
"I know that--it's been said in my hearing, but I don't care in the least; it is natural for the perfectly natural person _not_ to care in the least."
"I think, perhaps, it is easier for boys to be natural, than for girls," said Miss.
Juno.
"Yes, boys are naturally more natural," replied Paul with much confidence.
Miss.
Juno smiled an amused smile.
Paul resumed--"I hardly ever knew a girl who didn't wish herself a boy.
Did you ever see a boy who wanted to be a girl?"
"I've seen some who ought to have been girls--and who would have made very droll girls.
I know an old gentleman who used to bewail the degeneracy of the age and exclaim in despair, 'Boys will be girls!'"
laughed Miss.
Juno.
"Horrible thought!
But why is it that girlish boys are so unpleasant while tom-boys are delightful?"
"I don't know," replied she, "unless the girlish boy has lost the charm of his sex, that is manliness; and the tom-boy has lost the defect of hers--a kind of selfish dependence."
"I'm sure the girls like you, don't they?''
he added.
"Not always; and there are lots of girls I can't endure!"
"I've noticed that women who are most admired by women are seldom popular with men; and that the women the men go wild over are little appreciated by their own sex," said Paul.
"Yes, I've noticed that; as for myself my best friends are masculine; but when I was away at boarding-school my chum, who was immensely popular, used to call me Jack!"
"How awfully jolly; may I call you 'Jack' and will you be my chum?"
"Of course I will; but what idiots the world would think us."
"Who cares?"
cried he defiantly.
"There are millions of fellows this very moment who would give their all for such a pal as you are--Jack!"
There was a fluttering among the butterflies; the artists had risen and were standing waist-deep in the garden of gracious things; they were coming to Paul and Miss.
Juno, and in amusing pantomime announcing that pangs of hunger were compelling their return to the cottage; the truth is, it was long past the lunch hour--and a large music-box which had been set in motion when the light repast was laid had failed to catch the ear with its tinkling aria.
All four of the occupants of the garden turned leisurely toward the cottage.
Miss.
Juno had rested her hand on Paul's shoulder and said in a delightfully confidential way: "Let it be a secret that we are chums, dear boy--the world is such an idiot."
"All right, Jack," whispered Paul, trying to hug himself in delight, 'Little secrets are cozy.'"
And in the scent of the roses it was duly embalmed.
III

Happy is the man who is without encumbrances--that that is if he knows how to be happy.
Whenever Paul Clitheroe found the burden of the day becoming oppressive he cast it off, and sought solace in a change of scene.
He could always, or almost always, do this at a moment's notice.
It chanced, upon a certain occasion, when a little community of artists were celebrating the sale of a great picture--the masterpiece of one of their number--that word was sent to Paul to join their feast.
He found the large studio where several of them worked intermittently, highly decorated; a table was spread in a manner to have awakened an appetite even upon the palate of the surfeited; there were music and dancing, and bacchanalian revels that went on and on from night to day and on to night again.
It was a veritable feast of lanterns, and not until the last one had burned to the socket and the wine-vats were empty and the studio strewn with unrecognizable debris and permeated with odors stale, flat and unprofitable, did the revels cease.
Paul came to dine; he remained three days; he had not yet worn out his welcome, but he had resolved, as was his wont at intervals, to withdraw from the world, and so he returned to the Eyrie,--which was ever his initial step toward the accomplishment of the longed-for end.
Not very many days later Paul received the breeziest of letters; it was one of a series of racy rhapsodies that came to him bearing the Santa Rosa postmark.
They were such letters as a fellow might write to a college chum, but with no line that could have brought a blush to the cheek of modesty--not that the college chum is necessarily given to the inditing of such epistles.
These letters were signed "Jack."
"Jack" wrote to say how the world was all in bloom and the rose-garden one bewildering maze of blossoms; how Mama was still embroidering from nature in the midst thereof, crowned with a wreath of butterflies and with one uncommonly large one perched upon her Psyche shoulder and fanning her cheek with its brilliantly dyed wing; how Eugene was reveling in his art, painting lovely pictures of the old Spanish Missions with shadowy outlines of the ghostly fathers, long since departed, haunting the dismantled cloisters; how the air was like the breath of heaven, and the twilight unspeakably pathetic, and they were all three constantly reminded of Italy and forever talking of Rome and the Campagna, and Venice, and imagining themselves at home again and Paul with them, for they had resolved that he was quite out of his element in California; they had sworn he must be rescued; he must return with them to Italy and that right early.
He must wind up his affairs and set his house in order at once and forever; he should never go back to it again, but live a new life and a gentler life in that oldest and most gentle of lands; they simply _must_ take him with them and seat him by the shore of the Venetian Sea, where he could enjoy his melancholy, if he must be melancholy, and find himself for the first time provided with a suitable background.
This letter came to him inlaid with rose petals; they showered upon him in all their fragrance as he read the inspiring pages and, since "Jack" with quite a martial air had issued a mandate which ran as follows, "Order No.
19--Paul Clitheroe will, upon receipt of this, report immediately at headquarters at Santa Rosa," he placed the key of his outer door in his pocket and straightway departed without more ado.
*       *       *       *       *

They swung in individual hammocks, Paul and "Jack," within the rose-screened veranda.
The conjugal affinities, Violet and Eugene, were lost to the world in the depths of the rose-garden beyond sight and hearing.
Said Jack, resuming a rambling conversation which had been interrupted by the noisy passage of a bee, "That particular bee reminds me of some people who fret over their work, and who make others who are seeking rest, extremely uncomfortable."
Paul was thoughtful for a few moments and then remarked: "And yet it is a pleasant work he is engaged in, and his days are passed in the fairest fields; he evidently enjoys his trade even if he does seem to bustle about it.
I can excuse the buzz and the hum in him, when I can't always in the human tribes."
"If you knew what he was saying just now, perhaps you'd find him as disagreeable as the man who is condemned to earn his bread in the sweat of his brow, and makes more or less of a row about it."
"Very likely, Jack, but these bees are born with business instincts, and they can't enjoy loafing; they don't know how to be idle.
Being as busy as a busy bee must be being very busy!"
"There is the hum of the hive in that phrase, old boy!
I'm sure you've been working up to it all along.
Come now, confess, you've had that in hand for some little time."
"Well, what if I have?
That is what writers do, and they have to do it.
How else can they make their dialogue in the least attractive?
Did you ever write a story, Jack?"
"No, of course not; how perfectly absurd!"
"Not in the least absurd.
You've been reading novels ever since you were born.
You've the knack of the thing, the telling of a story, the developing of a plot, the final wind-up of the whole concern, right at your tongue's end."
"Paul, you're an idiot."
"Idiot, Jack?
I'm nothing of the sort and I can prove what I've just been saying to you about yourself.
Now, listen and don't interrupt me until I've said my say."
Paul caught hold of a branch of vine close at hand and set his hammock swinging slowly.
Miss.
Juno settled herself more comfortably in hers, and seemed much interested and amused.
"Now," said Paul, with a comical air of importance--"now, any one who has anything at his tongue's end, has it, or _can_, just as well as not, have it at his finger's end.
If you can tell a story well, and you can, Jack, you know you can, you can write it just as well.
You have only to tell it with your pen instead of with your lips; and if you will only write it exactly as you speak it, so long as your verbal version is a good one, your pen version is bound to be equally as good; moreover, it seems to me that in this way one is likely to adopt the most natural style, which is, of course, the best of all styles.
Now what do you say to that?"
"Oh, nothing," after a little pause--"however I doubt that any one, male or female, can take up pen for the first time and tell a tale like a practised writer."
"Of course not.
The practised writer has a style of his own, a conventional narrative style which may be very far from nature.
People in books very seldom talk as they do in real life.
When people in books begin to talk like human beings the reader thinks the dialogue either commonplace or mildly realistic, and votes it a bore."
"Then why try to write as one talks?
Why not cultivate the conventional style of the practised writer?"
"Why talk commonplaces?"
cried Paul a little tartly.
"Of course most people must do so if they talk at all, and they are usually the people who talk all the time.
But I have known people whose ordinary conversation was extraordinary, and worth putting down in a book--every word of it."
"In my experience," said Miss.
Juno, "people who talk like books are a burden."
"They needn't talk like the conventional book, I tell you.
Let them have something to say and say it cleverly--that is the kind of conversation to make books of."
"What if all that we've been saying here, under the rose, as it were, were printed just as we've said it?"
"What if it were?
It would at least be natural, and we've been saying something of interest to each other; why should it not interest a third party?"
Miss.
Juno smiled and rejoined, "I am not a confirmed eavesdropper, but I often find myself so situated that I cannot avoid overhearing what other people are saying to one another; it is seldom that, under such circumstances, I hear anything that interests me."
"Yes, but if you knew the true story of those very people, all that they may be saying in your hearing would no doubt possess an interest, inasmuch as it would serve to develop their history."
"Our conversation is growing a little thin, Paul, don't you think so?
We couldn't put all this into a book."
"If it helped to give a clue to our character and our motives, we could.
The thing is to be interesting: if we are interesting, in ourselves, by reason of our original charm or our unconventionality, almost anything we might say or do ought to interest others.
Conventional people are never interesting."
"Yet the majority of mankind is conventional to a degree; the conventionals help to fill up; their habitual love of conventionality, or their fear of the unconventional, is what keeps them in their place.
This is very fortunate.
On the other hand, a world full of people too clever to be kept in their proper spheres, would be simply intolerable.
But there is no danger of this!"
"Yes, you are right," said Paul after a moment's pause;--"you are interesting, and that is why I like you so well."
"You mean that I am unconventional?"
"Exactly.
And, as I said before, that is why I'm so awfully fond of you.
By Jove, I'm so glad I'm not in love with you, Jack."
"So am I, old boy; I couldn't put up with that at all; you'd have to go by the next train, you know; you would, really.
And yet, if we are to write a novel apiece we shall be obliged to put love into it; love with a very large L."

"No we wouldn't; I'm sure we wouldn't."
Miss.
Juno shook her golden locks in doubt--Paul went on persistently:--"I'm dead sure we wouldn't; and to prove it, some day I'll write a story without its pair of lovers; everybody shall be more or less spoony--but nobody shall be really in love."
"It wouldn't be a story, Paul."
"It would be a history, or a fragment of a history, a glimpse of a life at any rate, and that is as much as we ever get of the lives of those around us.
Why can't I tell you the story of one fellow--of myself for example; how one day I met this person, and the next day I met that person, and next week some one else comes on to the stage, and struts his little hour and departs.
I'm not trying to give my audience, my readers, any knowledge of that other fellow.
My reader must see for himself how each of those fellows in his own way has influenced me.
The story is my story, a study of myself, nothing more or less.
If the reader don't like me he may lay me down in my cloth or paper cover, and have nothing more to do with me.
If I'm not a hero, perhaps it's not so much my fault as my misfortune.
That people are interested in me, and show it in a thousand different ways, assures me that _my_ story, not the story of those with whom I'm thrown in contact, is what interests them.
It's a narrow-gauge, single-track story, but it runs through a delightful bit of country, and if my reader wants to look out of my windows and see things as I see them and find out how they influence me he is welcome; if he doesn't, he may get off at the very next station and change cars for Elsewhere."
"I shall have love in my story," said Miss.
Juno, with an amusing touch of sentiment that on her lips sounded like polite comedy.
"You may have all the love you like, and appeal to the same old novel-reader who has been reading the same sort of love story for the last hundred years, and when you've finished your work and your reader has stood by you to the sweet or bitter end, no one will be any the wiser or better.
You've taught nothing, you've untaught nothing----and there you are!"
"Oh!
A young man with a mission!
Do you propose to revolutionize?"
"No; revolutions only roil the water.
You might as well try to make water flow up-hill as to really revolutionize anything.
I'd beautify the banks of the stream, and round the sharp turns in it, and weed it out, and sow water-lilies, and set the white swan with her snow-flecked breast afloat.
That's what I'd do!"
"That's the art of the landscape gardener; I don't clearly see how it is of benefit to the novelist, Paul!
Now, honestly, is it?"
"You don't catch my meaning, Jack; girls are deuced dull, you know,--I mean obtuse."
Miss.
Juno flushed.
"I wasn't referring to the novel; I was saying that instead of writing my all in a vain effort to revolutionize anything in particular, I'd try to get all the good I could out of the existing evil, and make the best of it.
But let's not talk in this vein any longer; I hate argument.
Argument is nothing but a logical or illogical set-to; begin it as politely as you please, it is not long before both parties throw aside their gloves and go in with naked and bloody fists; one of the two gets knocked out, but he hasn't been convinced of anything in particular; he was not in condition, that is all; better luck next time."
"Have you the tobacco, Paul?"
asked Miss Juno, extending her hand.
The tobacco was silently passed from one hammock to the other; each rolled a cigarette, and lit it.
Paul blew a great smoke ring into the air; his companion blew a lesser one that shot rapidly after the larger halo, and the two were speedily blended in a pretty vapor wraith.
"That's the ghost of an argument, Jack," said Paul, glancing above.
He resumed: "What I was about to say when I was interrupted"--this was his pet joke; he knew well enough that he had been monopolizing the conversation of the morning--"what I was about to say was this: my novel shall be full of love, but you won't know that it is love--I mean the every-day love of the every-day people.
In my book everybody is going to love everybody else--or almost everybody else; if there is any sort of a misunderstanding it sha'n't matter much.
I hate rows; I believe in the truest and the fondest fellowship.
What is true love?
It is bosom friendship; that is the purest passion of love.
It is the only love that lasts."
There was a silence for the space of some minutes; Paul and Miss.
Juno were quietly, dreamily smoking.
Without, among the roses, there was the boom of bees; the carol of birds, the flutter of balancing butterflies.
Nature was very soothing, she was in one of her sweetest moods.
The two friends were growing drowsy.
Miss.
Juno, if she at times betrayed a feminine fondness for argument, was certainly in no haste to provoke Paul to a further discussion of the quality of love or friendship; presently she began rather languidly:

"You were saying I ought to write, and that you believe I can, if I will only try.
I'm going to try; I've been thinking of something that happened within my knowledge; perhaps I can make a magazine sketch of it."
"Oh, please write it, Jack!
Write it, and send the manuscript to me, that I may place it for you; will you?
Promise me you will!"
The boy was quite enthusiastic, and his undisguised pleasure in the prospect of seeing something from the pen of his pal--as he loved to call Miss.
Juno--seemed to awaken a responsive echo in her heart.
"I will, Paul; I promise you!"
--and the two struck hands on it.
IV

When Paul returned to the Eyrie, it had been decided that Miss.
Juno was to at once begin her first contribution to periodic literature.
She had found her plot; she had only to tell her story in her own way, just as if she were recounting it to Paul.
Indeed, at his suggestion, she had promised to sit with pen in hand and address him as if he were actually present.
In this way he hoped she would drop into the narrative style natural to her, and so attractive to her listeners.
As for Paul Clitheroe, he was to make inquiry among his editorial friends in the Misty City, and see if he might not effect some satisfactory arrangement with one or another of them, whereby he would be placed in a position enabling him to go abroad in the course of a few weeks, and remain abroad indefinitely.
He would make Venice his headquarters; he would have the constant society of his friends; the fellowship of Jack; together, after the joint literary labors of the day, they would stem the sluggish tide of the darksome canals and exchange sentiment and cigarette smoke in mutual delight.
Paul was to write a weekly or a semi-monthly letter to the journal employing him as a special correspondent.
At intervals, in the company of his friends, or alone, he would set forth upon one of those charming excursions so fruitful of picturesque experience, and return to his lodgings on the Schiavoni, to work them up into magazine articles; these would later, of course, get into book form; from the book would come increased reputation, a larger source of revenue, and the contentment of success which he so longed for, so often thought he had found, and so seldom enjoyed for any length of time.
All this was to be arranged,--or rather the means to which all this was the delightful end--was to be settled as soon as possible.
Miss.
Juno, having finished her story, was to send word to Paul and he was to hie him to the Rose Garden; thereafter at an ideal dinner, elaborated in honor of the occasion, Eugene was to read the maiden effort, while the author, sustained by the sympathetic presence of her admiring Mama and her devoted Paul, awaited the verdict.
This was to be the test--a trying one for Miss Juno.
As for Paul, he felt quite patriarchal, and yet, so genuine and so deep was his interest in the future of his protegee, that he was already showing symptoms of anxiety.
The article having been sent to the editor of the first magazine in the land, the family would be ready to fold its aesthetic tent and depart; Paul, of course, accompanying them.
It was a happy thought; visions of Venice; the moonlit lagoon; the reflected lamps plunging their tongues of flame into the sea; the humid air, the almost breathless silence, broken at intervals by the baying of deep-mouthed bells; the splash of oars; the soft tripping measure of human voices and the refrain of the gondoliers; Jack by his side--Jack now in her element, with the maroon fez of the distinguished howadji tilted upon the back of her handsome head, her shapely finger-nails stained with henna, her wrists weighed down with their scores of tinkling bangles!
Could anything be jollier?
Paul gave himself up to the full enjoyment of this dream.
Already he seemed to have overcome every obstacle, and to be reveling in the subdued but sensuous joys of the Adriatic queen.
Sometimes he had fled in spirit to the sweet seclusion of the cloistral life at San Lazaro.
Byron did it before him;--the plump, the soft-voiced, mild-visaged little Arminians will tell you all about that, and take immense pleasure in the telling of it.
Paul had also known a fellow-writer who had emulated Byron, and had even distanced the Byron record in one respect at least--he had outstayed his lordship at San Lazaro!
Sometimes Paul turned hermit, in imagination and dwelt alone upon the long sands of the melancholy Lido; not seeing Jack, or anybody, save the waiter at the neighboring restaurant, for days and days together.
It was immensely diverting, this dream-life that Paul led in far distant Venice.
It was just the life he loved, the ideal life, and it wasn't costing him a cent--no, not a _soldo_, to speak more in the Venetian manner.
While he was looking forward to the life to come, he had hardly time to perfect his arrangements for a realization of it.
He was to pack everything and store it in a bonded warehouse, where it should remain until he had taken root abroad.
Then he would send for it and settle in the spot he loved best of all, and there write and dream and drink the wine of the country, while the Angelus bells ringing thrice a day awoke him to a realizing sense of the fairy-like flight of time just as they have been doing for ages past, and, let us hope, as they will continue to do forever and forever.
One day he stopped dreaming of Italy, and resolved to secure his engagement as a correspondent.
Miss.
Juno had written him that her sketch was nearly finished; that he must hold himself in readiness to answer her summons at a moment's notice.
The season was advancing; no time was to be lost, etc.
Paul started at once for the office of his favorite journal; his interview was not entirely satisfactory.
Editors, one and all, as he called upon them in succession, didn't seem especially anxious to send the young man abroad for an indefinite period; the salary requested seemed exorbitant.
They each made a proposition; all said: "This is the best I can do at present; go to the other offices, and if you receive a better offer we advise you to take it."
This seemed reasonable enough, but as their best rate was fifteen dollars for one letter a week he feared that even the highly respectable second-class accommodations of all sorts to which he must confine himself would be beyond his means.
Was he losing interest in the scheme which had afforded him so many hours of sweet, if not solid, satisfaction?
No, not exactly.
Poverty was more picturesque abroad than in his prosaic native land.
His song was not quite so joyous, that was all; he would go to Italy; he would take a smaller room; he would eat at the Trattoria of the people; he would make studies of the peasant, the _contadini_.
Jack had written, "There is pie in Venice when we are there; Mama knows how to make pie; pie cannot be purchased elsewhere.
Love is the price thereof!"
And pie is very filling.
Yes, he would go to Europe on fifteen dollars per week and find paradise in the bright particular Venetian Pie!
V

After many days a great change came to pass.
Everybody knew that Paul Clitheroe had disappeared without so much as a "good-by" to his most intimate friends.
Curiosity was excited for a little while, but for a little while only.
Soon he was forgotten, or remembered by no one save those who had known and loved him and who at intervals regretted him.
And Miss.
Juno?
Ah, Miss.
Juno, the joy of Paul's young dreams!
Having been launched successfully at his hands, and hoping in her brave, off-hand way to be of service to him, she continued to write as much for his sake as for her own; she knew it would please him beyond compare were she to achieve a pronounced literary success.
He had urged her to write a novel.
She had lightly laughed him to scorn--and had kept turning in her mind the possible plot for a tale.
One day it suddenly took shape; the whole thing seemed to her perfectly plain sailing; if Clitheroe had launched her upon that venturesome sea, she had suddenly found herself equipped and able to sail without the aid of any one.
She had written to Paul of her joy in this new discovery.
Before her loomed the misty outlines of fair far islands; she was about to set forth to people these.
Oh, the joy of that!
The unspeakable joy of it!
She spread all sail on this voyage of discovery--she asked for nothing more save the prayers of her old comrade.
She longed to have him near her so that together they might discuss the situations in her story, one after another.
If he were only in Venice they would meet daily over their dinner, and after dinner she would read to him what she had written since they last met; then they would go in a gondola for a moonlight cruise; of course it was always moonlight in Venice!
Would this not be delightful and just as an all-wise Providence meant it should be?
Paul had read something like this in the letters which she used to write him when he was divided against himself; when he began to feel himself sinking, without a hand to help him.
Venice was out of the question then; it were vain for him to even dream of it.
So time went on; Miss.
Juno became a slave of the lamp; her work grew marvelously under her pen.
Her little people led her a merry chase; they whispered in her ears night and day; she got no rest of them--but rose again and again to put down the clever things they said, and so, almost before she knew it, her novel had grown into three fine English volumes with inch-broad margins, half-inch spacings, large type and heavy paper.
She was amazed to find how important her work had become.
Fortune favored her.
She found a publisher who was ready to bring out her book at once; two sets of proofs were forwarded to her; these she corrected with deep delight, returning one to her London publisher and sending one to America, where another publisher was ready to issue the work simultaneously with the English print.
It made its appearance under a pen-name in England--anonymously in America.
What curiosity it awakened may be judged by the instantaneous success of the work in both countries: Tauchnitz at once added it to his fascinating list; the French and German translators negotiated for the right to run it as a serial in Paris and Berlin journals.
Considerable curiosity was awakened concerning the identity of the authorship, and the personal paragraphers made a thousand conjectures, all of which helped the sale of the novel immensely and amused Miss.
Juno and her confidants beyond expression.
All this was known to Clitheroe before he had reached the climax that forced him to the wall.
He had written to Miss.
Juno; and he had called her "Jack" as of old, but he felt and she realized that he felt that the conditions were changed.
The atmosphere of the rose-garden was gone forever; the hopes and aspirations that were so easy and so airy then, had folded their wings like bruised butterflies or faded like the flowers.
She resolved to wait until he had recovered his senses and then perhaps he would come to Venice and to them--which in her estimation amounted to one and the same thing.
She wrote to him no more; he had not written her for weeks, save only the few lines of congratulation on the success of her novel, and to thank her for the author's copy she had sent him: the three-volume London edition with a fond inscription on the flyleaf--a line in each volume.
This was the end of all that.
Once more she wrote, but not to Clitheroe; she wrote to a friend she had known when she was in the far West, one who knew Paul well and was always eager for news of him.
The letter, or a part of it, ran as follows:

"Of course such weather as this is not to be shut out-of-doors; we feed on it; we drink it in; we bathe in it, body and soul.
Ah, my friend, know a June in Venice before you die!
Don't dare to die until you have become saturated with the aerial-aquatic beauty of this Divine Sea-City!
"Oh, I was about to tell you something when the charms of this Syren made me half-delirious and of course I forgot all else in life--I always do so.
Well, as we leave in a few days for the delectable Dolonites, we are making our rounds of P. P. C.'s,--that we are revisiting every nook and corner in the lagoon so dear to us.
We invariably do this; it is the most delicious leave-taking imaginable.
If I were only Niobe I'd water these shores with tears--I'm sure I would; but you know I never weep; I never did; I don't know how; there is not a drop of brine in my whole composition.
"Dear me!
how I do rattle on--but you know my moods and will make due allowance for what might strike the cold, unfeeling world as being garrulity.
"We had resolved to visit that most enchanting of all Italian shrines, San Francisco del Deserto.
We had not been there for an age; you know it is rather a long pull over, and one waits for the most perfect hour when one ventures upon the outskirts of the lagoon.
"Oh, the unspeakable loveliness of that perfect day!
The mellowing haze that veiled the water; the heavenly blue of the sea, a mirror of the sky, and floating in between the two, so that one could not be quite sure whether it slumbered in the lap of the sea or hung upon the bosom of the sky, that ideal summer island--San Francisco del Deserto.
"You know it is only a few acres in extent--not more than six, I fancy, and four-fifths of it are walled about with walls that stand knee-deep in sea-grasses.
Along, and above it, are thrust the tapering tops of those highly decorative cypresses without which Italy would not be herself at all.
There is such a monastery there--an ideal one, with cloister, and sundial, and marble-curbed well, and all that; at least so I am told; we poor feminine creatures are not permitted to cross the thresholds of these Holy Houses.
This reminds me of a remark I heard made by a very clever woman who wished to have a glimpse of the interior of that impossible Monte Casino on the mountain top between Rome and Naples.
Of course she was refused admission; she turned upon the poor Benedictine, who was only obeying orders--it is a rule of the house, you know--and said, 'Why do you refuse me admission to this shrine?
Is it because I am of the same sex as the mother of your God?'
But she didn't get in for all that.
Neither have I crossed the threshold of San Francisco del Deserto, but I have wandered upon the green in front of the little chapel; and sat under the trees in contemplation of the sea and wished--yes, really and truly wished--that I were a barefooted Franciscan friar with nothing to do but look picturesque in such a terrestrial paradise.
"What do you think happened when we were there the other day?
Now at last I am coming to it.
We were all upon the Campo in front of the chapel--Violet, Eugene and I; the Angelus had just rung; it was the hour of all hours in one's lifetime; the deepening twilight--we had the moon to light us on our homeward way--the inexpressible loveliness of the atmosphere, the unutterable peace, the unspeakable serenity--the repose in nature--I cannot begin to express myself!
"Out of the chapel came the Father Superior.
He knows us very well, for we have often visited the island; he always offers us some refreshment, a cup of mass wine, or a dish of fruit, and so he did on this occasion.
We were in no hurry to leave the shore and so accepted his invitation to be seated under the trees while he ordered the repast.
"Presently he returned and was shortly followed by a young friar whom we had never seen before; there are not many of them there--a dozen perhaps--and their faces are more or less familiar to us, for even we poor women may kneel without the gratings in their little chapel, and so we have learned to know the faces we have seen there in the choir.
But this one was quite new to us and so striking; his eyes were ever raised; he offered us a dish of bread and olives, while the abbot poured our wine, and the very moment we had served ourselves he quietly withdrew.
"I could think of but one thing--indeed we all thought of it at the same moment--'tis Browning's--

"'What's become of Waring     Since he gave us all the slip?'"
"You know the lines well enough.
Why did we think of it?--because we were all startled, so startled that the abbot who usually sees us to our gondola, made his abrupt adieus, on some slight pretext, and the door of the monastery was bolted fast.
"Oh, me!
How long it takes to tell a little tale--to be sure!
We knew that face, the face of the young friar; we knew the hand--it was unmistakable; we have all agreed upon it and are ready to swear to it on our oaths!
That novice was none other than Paul Clitheroe!"
A LITTLE SAVAGE GENTLEMAN

BY

ISOBEL STRONG

Reprinted from _Scribner's Magazine_ by permission

"IF YOU want a child as badly as all that," my brother said, "why not adopt a chief's son, some one who is handsome and well-born, and will be a credit to you, instead of crying your eyes out over a little common brat who is an ungrateful cub, and ugly into the bargain?"
I wasn't particularly fond of the "common brat," but I had grown used to tending him, bandaging his miserable little foot and trying to make his lot easier to bear; and he had been spirited away.
One may live long in Samoa without understanding the whys and wherefores.
His mother may have been jealous of my care of the child and carried him away in the night; or the clan to which he belonged may have sent for him, though his reputed father was our assistant cook.
At any rate, he had gone--departed as completely and entirely as though he had vanished into thin air, and I, sitting on the steps of the veranda, gave way to tears.
Two days later, as I hastened across the courtyard, I turned the corner suddenly, nearly falling over a small Samoan boy, who stood erect in a gallant pose before the house, leaning upon a long stick of sugar-cane, as though it were a spear.
"Who are you?"
I asked, in the native language.
"I am your son," was the surprising reply.
"And what is your name?"
"Pola," he said.
"Pola, of Tanugamanono, and my mother is the white chief lady, Teuila of Vailima."
He was a beautiful creature, of an even tint of light bronze-brown; his slender body reflected the polish of scented cocoanut oil, the tiny garment he called his _lava-lava_ fastened at the waist was coquettishly kilted above one knee.
He wore a necklace of scarlet berries across his shoulders, and a bright red hibiscus flower stuck behind his ear.
On his round, smooth cheek a single rose-leaf hid the dimple.
His large black eyes looked up at me with an expression of terror, overcome by pure physical courage.
From the top of his curly head to the soles of his high-arched slender foot he looked _tama'alii_--high-bred.
To all my inquiries he answered in purest high-chief Samoan that he was my son.
My brother came to the rescue with explanations.
Taking pity on me, he had gone to our village (as we called Tanugamanono) and adopted the chief's second son in my name, and here he was come to present himself in person.
I shook hands with him, a ceremony he performed very gracefully with great dignity.
Then he offered me the six feet of sugar-cane, with the remark that it was a small, trifling gift, unworthy of my high-chief notice.
I accepted it with a show of great joy and appreciation, though by a turn of the head one could see acres of sugar-cane growing on the other side of the river.
There was an element of embarrassment in the possession of this charming creature.
I could not speak the Samoan language very well at that time, and saw, by his vague but polite smile, that much of my conversation was incomprehensible to him.
His language to me was so extremely "high-chief" that I couldn't understand more than three words in a sentence.
What made the situation still more poignant was that look of repressed fear glinting in the depths of his black velvety eyes.
I took him by the hand (that trembled slightly in mine, though he walked boldly along with me) and led him about the house, thinking the sight of all the wonders of Vailima might divert his mind.
When I threw open the door of the hall, with its pictures and statues, waxed floor and glitter of silver on the sideboard, Pola made the regulation quotation from Scripture, "And behold the half has not been told me."
He went quite close to the tiger-skin, with the glass eyes and big teeth.
"It is not living?"
he asked, and when I assured him it was dead he remarked that it was a large pussy, and then added, gravely, that he supposed the forests of London were filled with these animals.
He held my hand quite tightly going up the stairs, and I realized then that he could never have mounted a staircase before.
Indeed, everything in the house, even chairs and tables, books and pictures, were new and strange to this little savage gentleman.
I took him to my room, where I had a number of letters to write.
He sat on the floor at my feet very obediently while I went on with my work.
Looking down a few minutes later I saw that he had fallen asleep, lying on a while rug in a childish, graceful attitude, and I realized again his wild beauty and charm.
Late in the day, as it began to grow dark, I asked Pola if he did not want to go home.
"No, Teuila," he answered, bravely.
"But you will be my boy just the same," I explained.
"Only you see Tumau (his real mother) will be lonely at first.
So you can sleep at the village and come and see me during the day."
His eyes lit up with that and the first smile of the day overspread his face, showing the whitest teeth imaginable.
It was not long before he was perfectly at home in Vailima.
He would arrive in the morning early, attended by a serving-man of his family, who walked meekly in the young chief's footsteps, carrying the usual gift for me.
Sometimes it was sugar-cane, or a wreath woven by the village girls, or a single fish wrapped in a piece of banana-leaf, or a few fresh water prawns, or even a bunch of wayside flowers; my little son seldom came empty-handed.
It was Pola who really taught me the Samoan language.
Ordinarily the natives cannot simplify their remarks for foreigners, but Pola invented a sort of Samoan baby-talk for me; sometimes, if I could not understand, he would shake me with his fierce little brown hands, crying, "Stupid, stupid!"
But generally he was extremely patient with me, trying a sentence in half a dozen different ways, with his bright eyes fixed eagerly on my face, and when the sense of what he said dawned upon me and I repeated it to prove that I understood, his own countenance would light up with an expression of absolute pride and triumph.
"Good!"
he would say, approvingly.
"Great is your high-chief wisdom!"
Once we spent a happy afternoon together in the forest picking up queer land-shells, bright berries and curious flowers, while Pola dug up a number of plants by the roots.
I asked him the next day what he had done with the beautiful red flowers.
His reply was beyond me, so I shook my head.
He looked at me anxiously for a moment with that worried expression that so often crossed his face in conversation with me, and, patting the floor, scraped up an imaginary hole, "They sit down in the dusty," he said in baby Samoan.
"Where?"
I asked.
"In front of Tumau."
And then I understood that he had planted them in the ground before his mother's house.
Another time he came up all laughter and excitement to tell of an adventure.
"Your brother," he said, "the high-chief Loia, he of the four eyes (eye-glasses), came riding by the village as I was walking up to Vailima.
He offered me a ride on his chief-horse and gave me his chief-hand.
I put my foot on the stirrup, and just as I jumped the horse shied, and, as I had hold of the high-chief Loia, we both fell off into the road _palasi_."
"Yes," I said, "you both fell off.
That was very funny."
"_Palasi_!"
he reiterated.
But here I looked doubtful.
Pola repeated his word several times as though the very sound ought to convey some idea to my bemuddled brain, and then a bright idea struck him.
I heard his bare feet pattering swiftly down the stairs.
He came flying back, still laughing, and laid a heavy dictionary in my lap.
I hastily turned the leaves, Pola questing in each one like an excited little dog, till I found the definition of his word, "to fall squash like a ripe fruit on the ground."
"_Palasi_!"
he cried, triumphantly, when he saw I understood, making a gesture downward with both hands, the while laughing heartily.
"We both fell off _palasi_!"
It was through Pola that I learned all the news of Tanugamanono.
He would curl up on the floor at my feet as I sat in my room sewing, and pour forth an endless stream of village gossip.
How Mata, the native parson, had whipped his daughter for going to a picnic on Sunday and drinking a glass of beer.
"Her father went whack!
whack!"
Pola illustrated the scene with gusto, "and Maua cried, ah!
ah!
But the village says Mata is right, for we must not let the white man's evil come near us."
"Evil?"
I said; "what evil?"
"Drink," said Pola, solemnly.
Then he told how "the ladies of Tanugamanono" bought a pig of Mr. B., a trader, each contributing a dollar until forty dollars were collected.
There was to be a grand feast among the ladies on account of the choosing of a maid or _taupo_, the young girl who represents the village on all state occasions.
When the pig came it turned out to be an old boar, so tough and rank it could not be eaten.
The ladies were much ashamed before their guests, and asked the white man for another pig, but he only laughed at them.
He had their money, so he did not care, "That was very, very bad of him," I exclaimed, indignantly.
"It is the way of white people," said Pola, philosophically.
It was through my little chief that we learned of a bit of fine hospitality.
It seems that pigs were scarce in the village, so each house-chief pledged himself to refrain from killing one of them for six months.
Any one breaking this rule agreed to give over his house to be looted by the village.
Pola came up rather late one morning, and told me, hilariously, of the fun they had had looting Tupuola's house.
"But Tupuola is a friend of ours," I said.
"I don't like to hear of all his belongings being scattered."
"It is all right," Pola explained.
"Tupuola said to the village, 'Come and loot.
I have broken the law and I will pay the forfeit.'"
"How did he break the law?"
I asked.
"When the high-chief Loia, your brother of the four eyes, stopped the night at Tanugamanono, on his way to the shark fishing, he stayed with Tupuola, so of course it was chiefly to kill a pig in his honor."
"But it was against the law.
My brother would not have liked it, and Tupuola must have felt badly to know his house was to be looted."
"He would have felt worse," said Pola, "to have acted unchiefly to a friend."
We never would have known of the famine in Tanugamanono if it had not been for Pola.
The hurricane had blown off all the young nuts from the cocoanut palms and the fruit from the breadfruit trees, while the taro was not yet ripe.
We passed the village daily.
The chief was my brother's dear friend; the girls often came up to decorate the place for a dinner party, but we had no hint of any distress in the village.
One morning I gave Pola two large ship's biscuits from the pantry.
"Be not angry," said Pola, "but I prefer to carry these home."
"Eat them," I said, "and I will give you more."
Before leaving that night he came to remind me of this.
I was swinging in a hammock reading a novel when Pola came to kiss my hand and bid me good night.
"_Love_," I said, "_Talofa_."
"_Soifua_," Pola replied, "may you sleep;" and then he added, "Be not angry, but the biscuits----"

"Are you hungry?"
I asked.
"Didn't you have your dinner?"
"Oh, yes, plenty of pea-soupo" (a general name for anything in tins); "but you said, in your high-chief kindness, that if I ate the two biscuits you would give me more to take home."
"And you ate them?"
He hesitated a perceptible moment, and then said:

"Yes, I ate them."
He looked so glowing and sweet, leaning forward to beg a favor, that I suddenly pulled him to me by his bare, brown shoulders for a kiss.
He fell against the hammock and two large round ship's biscuits slipped from under his _lava-lava_.
"Oh, Pola!"
I cried, reproachfully.
It cut me to the heart that he should lie to me.
He picked them up in silence, repressing the tears that stood in his big black eyes, and turned to go.
I felt there was something strange in this, one of those mysterious Samoan affairs that had so often baffled me.
"I will give you two more biscuits," I said, quietly, "if you will explain why you told a wicked lie and pained the heart that loved you."
"Teuila," he cried, anxiously, "I love you.
I would not pain your heart for all the world.
But they are starving in the village.
My father, the chief, divides the food, so that each child and old person and all shall share alike, and today there was only green baked bananas, two for each, and tonight when I return there will be again a division of one for each member of the village.
It seems hard that I should come here and eat and eat, and my brother and my two little sisters, and the good Tumau also, should have only one banana.
So I thought I would say to you, 'Behold, I have eaten the two biscuits,' and then you would give me two more and that would be enough for one each to my two sisters and Tumau and my brother, who is older than I."
That night my brother went down to the village and interviewed the chief.
It was all true, as Pola had said, only they had been too proud to mention it.
Mr. Stevenson sent bags of rice and kegs of beef to the village, and gave them permission to dig for edible roots in our forest, so they were able to tide over until the taro and yams were ripe.
Pola always spoke of Vailima as "our place," and Mr. Stevenson as "my chief."
I had given him a little brown pony that exactly matched his own skin.
A missionary, meeting him in the forest road as he was galloping along like a young centaur, asked, "Who are you?"
"I," answered Pola, reining in his pony with a gallant air, "am one of the Vailima men!"
He proved, however, that he considered himself a true Samoan by a conversation we had together once when we were walking down to Apia.
We passed a new house where a number of half-caste carpenters were briskly at work.
"See how clever these men are, Pola," I said, "building the white man's house.
When you get older perhaps I will have you taught carpentering, that you may build houses and make money."
"Me?"
asked Pola, surprised.
"Yes," I replied.
"Don't you think that would be a good idea?"
"I am the son of a chief," said Pola.
"I know," I said, "that your highness is a very great personage, but all the same it is good to know how to make money.
Wouldn't you like to be a carpenter?"
"No," said Pola, scornfully, adding, with a wave of his arm that took in acres of breadfruit trees, banana groves, and taro patches, "Why should I work?
All this land belongs to me."
Once, when Pola had been particularly adorable, I told him, in a burst of affection, that he could have anything in the world he wanted, only begging him to name it.
He smiled, looked thoughtful for an instant, and then answered, that of all things in the world, he would like ear-rings, like those the sailors wear.
I bought him a pair the next time I went to town.
Then, armed with a cork and a needleful of white silk, I called Pola, and asked if he wanted the ear-rings badly enough to endure the necessary operation.
He smiled and walked up to me.
"Now, this is going to hurt, Pola," I said.
He stood perfectly straight when I pushed the needle through his ear and cut off a little piece of silk.
I looked anxiously in his face as he turned his head for me to pierce the other one.
I was so nervous that my hands trembled.
"Are you _sure_ it does not hurt, Pola, my pigeon?"
I asked, and I have never forgotten his answer.
"My father is a soldier," he said.
Pola's dress was a simple garment, a square of white muslin hemmed by his adopted mother.
Like all Samoans, he was naturally very clean, going with the rest of the "Vailima men" to swim in the waterfall twice a day.
He would wash his hair in the juice of wild oranges, clean his teeth with the inside husk of the cocoanut, and, putting on a fresh _lava-lava_, would wash out the discarded one in the river, laying it out in the sunshine to dry.
He was always decorated with flowers in some way--a necklace of jessamine buds, pointed red peppers, or the scarlet fruit of the pandanas.
Little white boys looked naked without their clothes, but Pola in a strip of muslin, with his wreath of flowers, or sea-shells, some ferns twisted about one ankle, perhaps, or a boar's tusk fastened to his left arm with strands of horse-hair, looked completely, even handsomely, dressed.
He was not too proud to lend a helping hand at any work going--setting the table, polishing the floor of the hall or the brass handles of the old cabinet, leading the horses to water, carrying pails for the milkmen, helping the cook in the kitchen, the butler in the pantry, or the cowboy in the fields; holding skeins of wool for Mr. Stevenson's mother, or trotting beside the lady of the house, "Tamaitai," as they all called her, carrying seeds or plants for her garden.
When my brother went out with a number of natives laden with surveying implements, Pola only stopped long enough to beg for a cane-knife before he was leading the party.
If Mr. Stevenson called for his horse and started to town it was always Pola who flew to open the gate for him, waving a "_Talofa_!"
and "Good luck to the traveling!"
The Samoans are not reserved, like the Indians, or haughty, like the Arabs.
They are a cheerful, lively people, who keenly enjoy a joke, laughing at the slightest provocation.
Pola bubbled over with fun, and his voice could be heard chattering and singing gaily at any hour of the day.
He made up little verses about me, which he sang to the graceful gestures of the Siva or native dance, showing unaffected delight when commended.
He cried out with joy and admiration when he first heard a hand-organ, and was excitedly happy when allowed to turn the handle.
I gave him a box of tin soldiers, which he played with for hours in my room.
He would arrange them on the floor, talking earnestly to himself in Samoan.
"These are brave brown men," he would mutter.
"They are fighting for Mata'afa.
Boom!
Boom!
These are white men.
They are fighting the Samoans.
Pouf!"
And with a wave of his arm he knocked down a whole battalion, with the scornful remark, "All white men are cowards."
After Mr. Stevenson's death so many of his Samoan friends begged for his photograph that we sent to Sydney for a supply, which was soon exhausted.
One afternoon Pola came in and remarked, in a very hurt and aggrieved manner, that he had been neglected in the way of photographs.
"But your father, the chief, has a large fine one."
"True," said Pola.
"But that is not mine.
I have the box presented to me by your high-chief goodness.
It has a little cover, and there I wish to put the sun-shadow of Tusitala, the beloved chief whom we all revere, but I more than the others because he was the head of my clan."
"To be sure," I said, and looked about for a photograph.
I found a picture cut from a weekly paper, one I remember that Mr. Stevenson himself had particularly disliked.
He would have been pleased had he seen the scornful way Pola threw the picture on the floor.
"I will not have that!"
he cried.
"It is pig-faced.
It is not the shadow of our chief."
He leaned against the door and wept.
"I have nothing else, Pola," I protested.
"Truly, if I had another picture of Tusitala I would give it to you."
He brightened up at once.
"There is the one in the smoking-room," he said, "where he walks back and forth.
That pleases me, for it looks like him."
He referred to an oil painting of Mr. Stevenson by Sargent.
I explained that I could not give him that.
"Then I will take the round one," he said, "of tin."
This last was the bronze _bas-relief_ by St. Gaudens.
I must have laughed involuntarily, for he went out deeply hurt.
Hearing a strange noise in the hall an hour or so later, I opened the door, and discovered Pola lying on his face, weeping bitterly.
"What _are_ you crying about?"
I asked.
"The shadow, the shadow," he sobbed.
"I want the sun-shadow of Tusitala."
I knocked at my mother's door across the hall, and at the sight of that tear-stained face her heart melted, and he was given the last photograph we had, which he wrapped in a banana-leaf, tying it carefully with a ribbon of grass.
We left Samoa after Mr. Stevenson's death, staying away for more than a year.
Pola wrote me letters by every mail in a large round hand, but they were too conventional to bear any impress of his mind.
He referred to our regretted separation, exhorting me to stand fast in the high-chief will of the Lord, and, with his love to each member of the family, mentioned by name and title, he prayed that I might live long, sleep well, and not forget Pola, my unworthy servant.
When we returned to Samoa we were up at dawn, on shipboard, watching the horizon for the first faint cloud that floats above the island of Upulu.
Already the familiar perfume came floating over the waters--that sweet blending of many odors, of cocoanut-oil and baking breadfruit, of jessamine and gardenia.
It smelt of home to us, leaning over the rail and watching.
First a cloud, then a shadow growing more and more distinct until we saw the outline of the island.
Then, as we drew nearer, the deep purple of the distant hills, the green of the rich forests, and the silvery ribbons where the waterfalls reflect the sunshine.
Among the fleet of boats skimming out to meet us was one far ahead of the others, a lone canoe propelled by a woman, with a single figure standing in the prow.
As the steamer drew near I made out the figure of Pola, dressed in wreaths and flowers in honor of my return.
As the anchor went down in the bay of Apia and the custom-house officer started to board, I called out, begging him to let the child come on first.
He drew aside.
The canoe shot up to the gangway, and Pola, all in his finery of fresh flowers, ran up the gangway and stepped forth on the deck.
The passengers drew back before the strange little figure, but he was too intent upon finding me to notice them.
"Teuila!"
he cried, joyfully, with the tears rolling down his cheeks.
I went forward to meet him, and, kneeling on the deck, caught him in my arms.
LOVE AND ADVERTISING

BY

RICHARD WALTON TULLY

Reprinted from _The Cosmopolitan Magazine_ of April, 1906 by permission

I DO NOT demand," said Mr. Pepper, "I simply suggest a change.
If you wish me to resign"--his self-deprecatory manner bespoke an impossible supposition--"very well.
But, if you see fit to find me a new assistant----" He paused, with an interrogatory cough.
It was the senior partner who answered, "We shall consider the matter."
The advertising manager's lean face took on an expression of satisfaction.
He bowed and disappeared through the door.
Young Kaufmann, the junior partner, smiled covertly.
But the elder man's face bespoke keen disappointment.
For it must be explained that Mr. Pepper's simple announcement bore vitally upon the only dissension that had ever visited the firm of Kaufmann & Houghton during the thirty years of its existence.
In 1875, when John Houghton, fresh from college, had come to New York to find his fortune, the elder Kaufmann had been a candy manufacturer with a modest trade on the East Side.
Young Houghton had taken the agency of a glucose firm.
The disposal of this product had brought the two together, with the result that a partnership had been formed to carry on a wholesale confectionery business.
Success in this venture had led to new and more profitable fields--the chewing-gum trade.
The rise to wealth of these two was the result of the careful plodding of the German workman, who kept the "K. & H." products up to an unvarying standard, joined with the other's energy and acumen in marketing the output.
And this mutual relation had been disturbed by but one difference.
When Houghton was disposed to consider a college man for a vacancy, Kaufmann had always been ready with his "practical man dot has vorked hiss vay."
And each time, in respect to his wishes, Houghton had given in, reflecting that perhaps (as Kaufmann said) it had been that he, himself, was a good business man in spite of his college training, not because of it; and, after all, college ideals had sunk since _his_ time.
And the college applicant had been sent away.
Young Johann Kaufmann graduated from grammar school.
Houghton suggested high school and college.
"Vat?
Nein!"
said the elder Kaufmann.
"I show him how better the gum to make."
And he did.
He put on an apron as of yore and started his son under his personal supervision in the washing-room.
He took off his apron when Johann knew all about handling chicle products, from importing-bag to tin-foil wrapper.
Then he died.
And this year troublesome conditions had come on.
The Consolidated Pepsin people were cutting in severely.
Orders for the great specialty of K. & H.--"Old Tulu"--had fallen.
Something had to be done.
Houghton, now senior partner, had proposed, and young Kaufmann agreed, that an advertising expert be secured.
But the agreement ended there.
For the first words of the junior partner showed Houghton that the spirit of the father was still sitting at that desk opposite, and smiling the same fat, phlegmatic smile at his supposed weakness for "dose college bitzness."
They had compromised upon Mr. Pepper, secured from Simpkins' Practical Advertising School.
But at the end of six months, Pepper's so-called "follow-up campaign" had failed to meet materially the steady inroads of the western men.
He had explained that it was the result of his need of an assistant.
It was determined to give him one.
Then, one night as he sat in his library, John Houghton had looked into a pair of blue eyes and promised to "give Tom Brainard the chance."
In consequence he had had his hair tousled, been given a resounding kiss and a crushing hug from the young lady on his knees.
For Dorothy Houghton, despite her nineteen years, still claimed that privilege from her father.
In that way, for the first time, a college man had come into the employ of K. & H., and been made the assistant of Mr. Pepper at the salary he demanded--"any old thing to start the ball rolling."
And now had come the information that the senior partner's long-desired experiment had ended in failure.
Young Kaufmann turned to his work with the air of one who has given a child its own way and seen it come to grief.
"I--I suppose," Houghton said slowly, "we'll have to let Brainard go."
And then a peculiar thing happened.
Through the open window, floating in the summer air, he seemed to see a familiar figure.
It was dressed in fluffy white, and carried a parasol over its shoulders.
It fluttered calmly in, seated itself on the sill, and gazed at him with blue eyes that were serious, reproachful.
"Daddy!"
it said, and it brushed away a wisp of hair by its ear--just as another one, long ago, had used to.
"Daddy!"
it faltered.
"Why did I ask you to give him the place, if it wasn't because--because----"

The spell was broken by Kaufmann's voice.
"Whatefer you do, I am sooted," he was saying.
It might have been his father.
"But if w'at Pepper says about Brainard----"

The senior partner straightened up and pushed a button.
"Yes.
But We haven't heard what Brainard says about Pepper."
Several moments later Tom Brainard entered.
Medium-sized and muscular, he was dressed in a loose-fitting suit that by its very cut told his training.
He stood between them as Mr. Pepper had done, but there was nothing of the other's ingratiating deference in his level look.
"Sit down, Brainard," said Houghton.
The newcomer did so, and the senior partner marked an attitude of laziness and indifference.
Houghton became stern.
"Brainard," he began, "I gave you a chance with us because----" He paused.
The other colored.
"I had hoped to make good without that."
"But this morning Mr. Pepper----"

"Said we couldn't get along together.
That's true."
"Ah!
You admit!"
It was Kaufmann.
"Yes."
There was a pause.
Then Houghton spoke.
"I can't tell you how much this disappoints me, Brainard.
The fact is, for years I have tried to shut my eyes to the development of college training.
In my time there was not the call for practicality that there is today.
Yet it seems to me that the training in our colleges has grown less and less practical.
Why do the colleges turn out men who spend their time in personal gossip over sport or trivialities?"
"You remember that the King of Spain--or was it Cambodia--puzzled his wise men for a year as to why a fish, when dropped into a full pail of water, didn't make it overflow."
"What's that got to do with it?"
"Because I must answer as the king did: It's not so--the pail _does_ overflow.
They hadn't thought to try it."
"You mean that I am wrong."
"Yes.
Are you sure your gossips were 'college men'?"
"Ah!"
Houghton made a gesture to his partner, who was about to speak.
"Then let us commence at the root of the matter.
Mr. Kaufmann and I have often discussed the subject.
In this case you are the one who has 'tried it.'
Suppose you explain our mistake."
"I'd be glad to do that," said Brainard, "because I've heard a lot of that talk."
"Well?"
"Well--of course when I say 'college man' I mean college graduate."
"Why?"
"If a kitten crawls into an oven, is it a biscuit?"
There was an earnestness that robbed the question of any flippancy.
Houghton laughed.
"No!"
"If a dub goes into college and gets flunked out in a month, is he a college man?"
"Hardly."
"Oh, but he calls himself one.
He goes to Podunk all decorated up in geraniums and the rest of his life is a 'college man.'
I'm not talking about him or the man who comes to college to learn to mix cocktails--inside.
He may last to the junior year.
I'm talking about the graduate--they're only about a tenth of the college.
But they're the finished product.
Mr. Kaufmann, you wouldn't try to sell gum that had only gone as far as the rolling-room, would you?"
"W'at--me?"
"Would you?"
"No."
The junior partner was puzzled.
"That's because you want it to go through all the processes.
Well, let's talk only about the boy who has gone all the way through the man factory."
Houghton nodded.
"That's fair."
"The trouble is, people don't do that.
They persist in butting into the college world, jerking out some sophomore celebration, and saying, 'What use is this silly thing in the real world?'"
"Well, aren't they right?"
"No.
That's just the point.
The college world is a mimic world--and your lifetime is just four years.
The sophomore celebration is a practical thing there; perhaps it's teaching loyalty--that generally comes first.
That's your college rolling-room.
But the graduate--he's learned to do _something_ well.
I never knew a college man who wasn't at least responsible."
"But----"

"But here's the trouble: after selecting say two hundred fellows out of an entering bunch of six hundred, and developing the thing each is best fitted for, _father_ steps in and the boy who would have made a first-class professor is put into business and blamed for being impractical.
The fellow who has been handling thousands of dollars in college management and running twenty assistants--the man who could have taken the place--has no father to give him the boost necessary, and the other man's failure has queered his chances.
He has to go to work as a mere clerk under a man--excuse me, I don't want to do any knocking."
"You think the whole trouble is caused by misdirected nepotism."
"Yes."
"Ah----" It was young Kaufmann again.
"But you said that you were trained in advertising on your college paper."
"Yes--and I was going to tell you today, if Mr. Pepper hadn't, that the money you're paying for me is utterly wasted."
"Ah!"
"Yes.
I can't look in the face of a hungry designer and beat him down to within a dollar of the cost of materials.
And--and--my suggestions upon broader lines don't seem to cause much hooray."
"Well--" the junior partner sat up--"since you admit----" He paused for his partner to speak the words of discharge.
But Houghton was looking quizzically at the college man.
"What was your idea as to broader lines?"
Brainard hesitated.
"Well, it seemed to me that Pepper is trying to do two things that are antagonistic: be _'elite'_ and sell chewing-gum.
The fact is that _elite_ people don't chew gum.
I'd like to know how the statement, 'Old Tulu--Best by Test,' will make a kid on the corner with a cent in his fist have an attack of mouth-watering."
Kaufmann roused himself.
"It is true.
Our gum _is_ the best."
"I'm not disputing that, but still it's _gum_.
If you're trying to increase the vulgar habit of gum-chewing--well--you can't do it by advertising the firm's financial standing, its age, or the purity of its output.
That would do for an insurance company or a bank--but _gum_!
Who cares for purity!
All they want to know is if it _schmeckt gut_."
This last with a humorous glance at Kaufmann.
The latter was scowling.
Brainard was touching a tender spot.
"Well, what would you do?"
Brainard flushed.
He felt the tone of sarcasm in the elder man's voice.
He tightened his lips.
"At least, I'd change the name of the gum!"
"Change the name!"
Kaufmann was horrified.
"Well, nobody wants 'Old Tulu.'
They want 'New Tulu' or 'Fresh Tasty Tulu.'
At least, something to appeal to the imagination of Sadie-at-the-ribbon-counter."
"Oh!"
observed Houghton.
"And the name you suggest?"
"Well,--say something like 'Lulu Tulu.'"
"Gott!"
Kaufmann struck the desk a blow with his fist.
It was an insult to his father's memory.
Brainard rose.
"I'm sorry," he said, "if I have offended.
To save you any further bother, I'll just cut it out after Saturday.
I--thank you for the chance"--he smiled a little ruefully--"the chance you have given me.
Good day, gentlemen."
He turned on his heel and left the office.
*       *       *       *       *

As John Houghton was driven home that night, he became suddenly conscious that he would soon meet the apparition of the afternoon in the flesh.
And though, of course, there was no need, he found himself rehearsing the justification of his position.
"Lulu Tulu" indeed!
Imagine the smile that would have illumined the faces at the club on such an announcement.
The impudence of the boy to have suggested it to him--him who had so often held forth upon the value of conservatism in business!
And he remembered with pride the speaker who had once said, "It is such solid vertebrae as Mr. Houghton that form the backbone of our business world."
That speaker had been Bender, of the New York Dynamo Company.
Poor Bender!
The Western Electric Construction had got him after all.
This line of thought caused Houghton to reach in his pocket and produce a letter.
He went over the significant part again.
"Our Mr. Byrnes reports the clinching of the subway vending-machine contract," it read, "and this, together with our other business, will give us over half of the New York trade.
With this statement before us, we feel that we can make a winning fight if you still refuse to consider our terms.
In view of recent developments, we cannot repeat our former offer but if you will consider sixty-seven as a figure----"

Sixty-seven!
And a year before he would not have taken one hundred and ten!
In the bitterness of the moment, he wondered if he, too, would finally go the way that Bender had.
And then, as the butler swung the door back, he was recalled to the matter of Tom Brainard by the sight of a familiar figure that floated toward him as airily as had its astral self that afternoon.
He kissed her and went to his study.
Just before dinner was not a time to discuss such things.
But later, as he looked across the candelabra at his daughter, all smiles and happiness in that seat that had been her mother's, he regretted that he had not, for----

"Daddy," Dorothy was saying, "I got such a funny note from Tom this afternoon.
He says there has been a change at the office and that you will explain."
"Yes."
"Well----?"
She paused eagerly.
"It's something awfully good--I know."
Her father frowned and caught her eye.
"Later," he said significantly.
The girl read the tone, and the gaiety of the moment before was gone.
After that they ate in silence.
One cigar--two cigars had been smoked when she stole into the library.
Since coffee (whether from design or chance he never knew), she had rearranged her hair.
Now it was low on her neck in a fashion of long ago, with a single curl that strayed over a white shoulder to her bosom.
She knelt at his side without a word.
He looked down at her.
Somehow he had never seen her like this before--that curious womanly expression.
"Tell me," was all she said.
And, as he told Tom Brainard's failure to fit in, he watched her closely.
"I'm sorry," he concluded.
"So am I, daddy," she returned steadily; "because I am going to marry him."
"What?"
"Oh, you knew--you must have," she said, "when I asked you to give him the chance."
The father was silent.
In fancy he again heard Dolly Warner promising, against her parents' advice, to wait for her John to "get on in the world."
"Well?"
he asked.
"Do you think you've given him a fair chance?"
He was restored to his usual poise.
"I suppose he complained that I didn't."
Dorothy's eyes went wide.
"No, he said that after I had heard the news from you, he would leave everything to me."
"Oh!"
"But, father, I don't think you _have_ been fair.
Tom is right.
_I_ don't chew gum, do I?"
"Well----" He was indignant.
Then he stopped thoughtfully.
"No."
"But Mary downstairs does.
She wouldn't be offended at 'Lulu Tulu.'
I dare say she'd think it 'just grand.'"
He returned no answer.
"Come, daddy," she went on.
"New York has grown lots--even since I was little.
And--and some people get behind the times.
They think they're being dignified when it's only that they're antiquated."
He looked shrewdly at her.
"I never heard you talk like that before.
Where did you----"

"Tom said that a week ago," she admitted.
"And he said, too, that he could double the results if he only had full swing.
Instead, you admit he's a mere clerk for that horrid Pepper.
Oh, daddy, daddy," she pleaded.
"Give him a chance."
Then her voice went low again.
"I'm going to marry him anyway," she said, "and you don't want this between.
If he fails, I'll stand the loss from what mother left me.
Give him full swing--a real chance, daddy!
He's going to be--_your son_."
John Houghton looked into the earnest girlish face.
He wound the curl about his finger.
"Kaufmann has always wanted to visit the Fatherland," he said irrelevantly.
She gave a quick, eager look.
"And that Pepper could go on a vacation."
*       *       *       *       *

Days drag very slowly at a summer resort, especially when one has promised not to write to him.
But Dorothy's father had kept his word, so she could but do the same.
Behind, in the sweltering city, in full charge for six weeks was Tom Brainard.
His authority included permission to invent and use any new labels or trade-marks he saw fit.
The girl at the seashore, however, was also busy--amusing her father that he might not give too much time to thinking.
And then, when three of the six weeks had passed, came the accident to the motor car.
She was told that with rest and no worries, her father would recover in a week or two.
She cheerfully fitted into the role of assistant to the nurse in charge, and, as soon as the doctor allowed, prepared to read his mail to him as he lay, eyes and head bandaged.
But as she opened and glanced over the accumulated letters, she suddenly went pale.
She read one in particular from end to end, and then, with a scared, furtive look at the bandaged figure, slipped it into a pocket.
Later, when her father had finished dictating to her, she answered the concealed letter herself.
Again the days drifted.
The bandages were removed; but still the girl continued to scan the mail.
Her vigilance was rewarded.
She flushed over a second letter which, with one in a worn envelope, she took to her father.
He saw the careworn expression.
"My little girl has been overworking," he said.
She held out the worn letter.
"I've had this for some time--but--but I waited for something more, and here it is."
She showed the other.
He took the first, and when he had finished, his hand was trembling.
"I regret to report that things are in a chaos," it ran.
"All of the regular advertising has been withdrawn.
The usual entertainment money for salesmen classed under this head has been stopped.
In consequence, our city trade has tumbled fearfully--and you know how bad it was before.
The worst news I have to offer is in regard to Mr. Brainard personally.
Our detective reports that his time outside is spent in most questionable company.
He has been seen drinking at roof-gardens with a certain dissipated pugilist named Little Sullivan, and was traced with this man to the apartment of a song-and-dance woman named Violette.
He seems to be spending money extravagantly and visits certain bohemian quarters in the vicinity of Jones Street, where he puts in his time with disreputable-looking men.
I beg leave to advise immediate action.--Mowbray."
"My God!"
groaned Houghton.
This explained that derisive offer of fifty-one from Consolidated Pepsin.
"And you kept this from me?"
"They said not to worry you," she said.
"I--I've had enough for two.
Besides, I answered it."
"You did!
What----?"
"I told them to wait a little longer."
The father groaned again.
"I just _had_ to, daddy; and then today this letter came."
He seized it eagerly.
It read: "You were right about waiting.
Suspend all action."
"What does it mean?"
she asked.
"We'll find out tomorrow," he answered grimly.
The 4:30 train gave John Houghton just time to reach the office before it closed.
Dorothy went home.
Her father, roused by the evil news of the day before, had impressed her with all that it might mean in a material way.
As though that mattered!--as though anything could hurt her more!
She would have been willing to go with Tom Brainard in rags before--but now!
She sat by the telephone with clenched fists, her traveling veil still pushed up on her hat, the lines that had come into her face during the past week deepening with the dusk.
At last--a long, sharp ring!
"Yes--father--not dine at home--meet you at the Yolland--a guest.
Yes--but about Tom--what?--7:30--But about Tom, daddy?
Good-by?!!
But, daddy!!!"
It was no use.
He had hung up.
She called feverishly for the office, but the reply was, "They do not answer."
Mechanically she went up to her room.
"The blue mousseline, Susan," she said.
As the maid laid it out, she walked the floor.
Through the window the park lay green and inviting.
She longed to fly to the cool grass and run--and run----

From below came the loud, rasping notes of a street-piano that, in some incomprehensible fashion, had wandered to the deserted row of houses.
The noise, for all that there was a pleasing swing to the air, irritated her.
She threw the man a quarter.
"Go away," she waved.
At last the maid said her mistress was ready, and Dorothy, without questioning the decision, allowed herself to be put into the brougham.
The drive seemed hours long, and then--her father's face told her nothing.
Without a word, he led her to a reception-room.
As they entered, a figure sprang to meet them.
For a moment she hesitated.
Then, "Tom!"
she cried, and caught his hand.
He saw the whiteness of her face, and all the yearnings of their separation matched it upon his.
"Dorothy!"
he faltered.
Her father interrupted.
"Tom is to explain how he has quadrupled our business in the last week."
A sudden weakness seized her.
She followed them unsteadily.
Seated at a table, however, she was able to smile again.
At that moment, the orchestra, striking up, suddenly caught her attention.
"Tum--tum-tum--tum-tum--tum"--that haunting, swinging melody of the street-piano.
"What tune is that?"
she asked.
Brainard smiled.
"_That_ is a tune that has suddenly become popular.
Any night you may see hundreds of East Side children dancing on the asphalt and singing it."
"Yes," she said.
"I heard it on a street-piano."
"It's called," he went on, '"My Lulu Tulu Girl.'
All the grinders have it.
Billy Tompkins, Noughty-three, who lives in the Jones Street social settlement, worked that for me.
Those dagoes worship him--saved a kid's life or something."
A light came into John Houghton's eyes.
"That's part of the scheme.
Aspwell wrote the song.
I found him down in bohemia working on an opera.
But, for the sake of old days in the senior extravaganza, he turned off 'My Lulu Tulu Girl.'
You know those orders on your desk are for our new brand, 'Lulu Tulu.'
The song was introduced two weeks ago at the Metropolitan Roof by Violette, a young lady who married our old football trainer, Little Sullivan.
We'll hear her later--I have tickets.
Then we'll go to Leith's; there's a turn there by 'Jim Bailey and his Six Lulu Tulu Girls'--rather vulgar (while they dance they chew the gum and perform calisthenics with it) but it seems to go.
Then----"

"Tom!"
"After we've dined, I'll show you our regular magazine and newspaper advertising in the reading-room--double space.
You see, I couldn't ask you to increase, so I stopped it for a time and saved up.
But I hope you'll stand for it regularly.
It's mainly pictures of Miss.
Lulu Tulu in a large Florodora hat, with verses below apostrophizing the poetry of motion of her jaws.
Then there's a line of limericks about the adventures of the 'Lulu Tulu Gummies'--small gum-headed tykes--always in trouble until they find Lulu.
I got Phillips to do that as a personal favor."
"Also Noughty-something, I suppose," remarked Houghton.
"Yes.
But he graduated before my time.
I knew his work in the college annual.
He's in the magazines now.
Then I got Professor Wheaton--'Jimmy the Grind' we used to call him--his folks wanted him to be a poet--imagine Jimmy a poet!--I got Professor Wheaton to give us some readers on 'Tulu as a Salivary Stimulant,' 'The Healthful Effect of Pure Saliva on Food Products' and 'The Degenerative Effect of Artificially Relieving an Organ of its Proper Functions.'
That hits the Pepsin people, you see----"

And so it ran--until he had covered his plan fully, and Dorothy's face with happy smiles.
"Tom," said the father, "if I had opened that letter instead of Dolly!"
Dorothy suddenly became demure under their gaze and sought to change the subject.
"Then you admit, daddy, that a college man is of some use?"
"I'll admit that Tom got the business.
But that was because he is naturally clever and business-like, not because----"

"Just a moment," said Brainard.
"I think I can show that you're mistaken.
I found out that Pepper was doing the wrong thing--by the first rule of criticism (freshman English): 'What is the author trying to do?
Does he do it?
Is it worth doing?'
Substitute 'advertising man' for 'author' and you have a business that is worth doing (since you continue it)--and by the other two questions I saw his incongruity of subject-matter and expression.'
My economics taught me the 'law of supply and demand.'
'Analytical research of original authorities' taught me where the demand was.
There was only the problem of a cause to stimulate it.
Through deductive logic' and 'psychology' I got the cause that would appeal, and the effect worked out in an increased demand which we were ready to supply--just like a problem in math."
The elder man smiled.
"I don't understand a word you say, but it seems to have _worked_ well.
In the future, bring in as many of your Noughty friends as we need.
I'll answer for Kaufmann."
The other shook his head.
"I'm not sure they would be any too anxious."
Houghton gasped in surprise.
"What's that--they wouldn't be anxious to go into _business_!
Why not?"
"Why not?"
There was equal amazement in the younger man's tone.
"Would you be anxious to leave a place where you're surrounded by friends you've tried--friends that won't stab you in the back the next minute and call it a 'business deal'--where you're respected and in control of things, and plunge out to become a freshman in the world-life, to do the sorting and trying all over again?"
"I remember--I remember----"

"And besides, what right has any one to assume that _business_ is above art, charity or even mere learning?
Billy Tompkins, in the slums helping dagoes, is a failure to his father--so is Aspwell with his opera--so is Williams with his spectacles in his lab.
But--who knows--when the Great Business is finally balanced----" He stopped, conscious that he was growing too rhetorical.
"If you loved college ideals so much more than business," observed Houghton, "then why did you come to us?"
A different light stole into the younger man's eyes.
"Because"--he answered, "because I loved something else better than either."
And he reached his hand under the cloth to one who understood.
That is all--except that the next offer of Consolidated Pepsin was, "Will you please name your own terms?"
THE TEWANA

BY

HERMAN WHITAKER

Reprinted from _The Blue Mule_ _A Western Magazine of Stories_, of February, 1906 by permission

SHE WAS a Tewana of the Tehuantepec Isthmus, a primal woman, round-armed, deep-breasted, shapely as the dream on which Canova modeled Venus.
Her skin was of the rich gold hue that marks the blood unmuddied by Spanish strain; to see her, poised on a rich hip by the river's brink, wringing her tresses after the morning bath, it were justifiable to mistake her for some beautiful bronze.
Moreover, it were easy to see her, for, in Tehuantepec, innocence is thoughtless as in old Eden.
When Paul Steiner passed her one morning, she gave him the curious open-eyed stare of a deer, bade him a pleasant "_Buenos dias, Senor!_" and would have proceeded, undisturbed, with her toilet, but that he spoke.
In this he was greatly mistaken.
Gringos there are--praise the saints!--who can judge Tehuantepec by the insight of kindred purity, but Paul had to learn by the more uncomfortable method of a stone in the face.
He ought not, however, to be too severely handled for his dulness.
Though a mining engineer, nature had endowed him with little beyond the algebraic qualities necessary to the profession; a German-American, a dull birth and heredity had predestined him for that class which clothes its morality in fusty black and finds safety in following its neighbor in the cut of its clothes and conduct.
As then, he was not planned for original thinking, it is not at all surprising that he should--when pitchforked by Opportunity into the depths of tropical jungles--lose his moral bearings, fail to recognize a virtue that went in her own golden skin, and so go down before a temptation that, of old, populated the sexless desert.
That his error continued in the face of Andrea's stone is certainly more remarkable, though this also should be charged rather against her mismarksmanship than to the wearing quality of his electro-plate morality.
It is doubtful if even the ancient Jews had found "stoning" as efficacious a "cure for souls" had they thrown wide as she.
Anyway, Paul stood "unconvicted," as the revivalists have it, and being moved to chagrin instead of shame, he carried the story of Andrea's surprising modesty to Bachelder.
Here was a man of other parts.
An artist, he had traced the spinning meridians over desert and sea, following the fluttering wing of the muse till she rewarded his deathless hope by pausing for him in this small Indian town.
Expecting to stay a week, he had remained fifteen years, failing to exhaust in that long time a tithe of its form and color.
Screened by tropical jungle, a mask of dark palms laced with twining _bejucas_, it sat like a wonderfully blazoned cup in a wide green saucer that was edged with the purple of low environing hills--a brimming cup of inspiration.
Save where some oaken grill supplied an ashen note, its adobe streets burned in smoldering rose, purple and gold--the latter always predominant.
It glowed in the molten sunlight, shone in the soft satin of a woman's skin; the very dust rose in auriferous clouds from the wooden-wheeled ox-carts.
But for its magenta tiling, the pillared market stood, a huge monochrome, its deep yellows splashed here and there with the crimson of the female hucksters' dresses.
This was their every-day wear--a sleeveless bodice, cut low over the matchless amplitudes and so short that the smooth waist showed at each uplift of the round, bronze arms; a skirt that was little more than a cloth wound about the limbs; a shawl, all of deep blood color.
Small wonder that he had stayed on, and on, and on, while the weeks merged into months, and months into years.
He lived in the town's great house, an old feudal hacienda with walls two yards thick, recessed windows oaken grilled, and a pleasant patio where the hidalgo could take his ease under cocoanut palms and lemon trees while governments went to smash without.
Here Bachelder was always to be found in the heat of the day, and here he listened with huge disgust to Paul's story.
Because of their faith, strength and purity--according to their standards--he had always sworn by the Tewana women, setting them above all others, and though a frank sinner against accepted moral codes, he would never have confused nudity with vice.
"Man!"
he exclaimed--so loudly that Rosa, his housekeeper, imagined that something was going wrong again with the painting--"Man!
all the dollars you will ever earn would buy nothing more than her stone!
If you want her, you will have to marry her."
"Oh, don't look so chopfallen!"
he went on, scornfully, when Paul blinked.
"I mean marriage as she counts it.
You will have to court her for a couple of months--flowers, little gifts, small courtesies, that sort of thing; then, if she likes you, she will come and keep your house.
When, later, you feel like settling down in the bosom of respectability, there won't be a shred of law to hold you."
Now if Paul lacked wit to analyze and apply to his own government a moral law that has evolved from the painful travail of the generations, it does not follow that he was too stupid to feel irony.
Reddening, he put forth the usual declaimer of honorable intention with the glib tongue of passion.
He meant well by the girl!
Would give her a good home, find her better than she had ever been found in her life!
As for marrying?
He was not of the marrying kind!
Never would!
and so on, finishing with a vital question--did Bachelder know where she lived?
His color deepened under the artist's sarcastic glance.
"So that's what you're after?
I wondered why you picked me for a father confessor.
Well, I don't, but you won't have any trouble in finding her.
All the women sell something; she's sure to be on the market in the morning.
You will get her quite easily.
The girls seem to take pride in keeping a Gringo's house--I don't know why, unless it be that they are so dazzled by the things we have that they cannot see us for what we are."
*       *       *       *       *

A thousand crimson figures were weaving in and out the market's chrome pillars when Paul entered next morning, but though it was hard to single one person from the red confusion, luck led him almost immediately to where Andrea stood, a basket of tortillas at her feet.
Lacking customers, just then, she leaned against a pillar, her scarlet flaming against its chrome, thoughtful, pensive, as Bachelder painted her for "The Enganchada," the girl sold for debt.
Her shawl lay beside her basket, so her hair, that had flown loose since the morning bath, fell in a cataract over the polished amplitudes of bosom and shoulders.
Save when feeling shot them with tawny flashes--as waving branches filter mottled sunlight on brown waters--her eyes were dark as the pools of Lethe, wherein men plunge and forget the past.
They brought forgetfulness to Paul of his moral tradition, racial pride, the carefully conned apology which he did not remember until, an hour later, he fed her entire stock in trade to his dog.
It was better so.
Black, brown or white women are alike sensitive to the language of flowers, and the lilies he left in her basket served him more sweetly than could his stammering tongue.
Next morning, curiosity replaced hostility in her glance, and when he left the market, her brown gaze followed him beyond the portals.
Needs not, however, to linger over the courtship.
Sufficient that color of skin does not affect the feminine trait that forgiveness comes easier when the offense was provoked by one's own beauty; the story goes on from the time that Andrea moved into his house with a stock of household gear that extorted musical exclamations from all her girl friends.
To their housekeeping Andrea contributed only her handsome body with a contained cargo of unsuspected qualities and virtues that simply dazzled Paul as they cropped out upon the surface.
In public a Tewana bears herself staidly, carrying a certain dignity of expression that of itself reveals how, of old, her forbears came to place limits to the ambition of the conquering Aztec and made even Spanish dominion little more than an uncomfortable name.
Though, through courtship, Andrea's stern composure had shown no trace of a thaw, it yet melted like snow under a south wind when she was once ensconced in their little home.
Moreover, she unmasked undreamed of batteries, bewildering Paul with infinite variety of feminine complexities.
She would be arch, gay, saucy, and in the next breath fall into one of love's warm silences, watching him with eyes of molten bronze.
She taught him the love of the tropics without transcending modesty.
Also she astonished him, negatively, by the absence of those wide differences of nature and feeling between her and the cultured women of his own land that reading in the primal school of fiction had led him to expect.
He learned from her that woman is always woman under any clime or epoch.
The greater strength of her physique lessened, perhaps, the vine-like tendency, yet she clung sufficiently to satisfy the needs of his masculinity; and she displayed the feminine unreason, at once so charming and irritating, with sufficient coquetry to freshen her love.
Her greatest charm, however, lay in the dominant quality of brooding motherhood, the birthright of primal women and the very essence of femininity.
After one of those sweet silences, she would steal on him from behind, and pull his head to her bosom with such a squeeze as a loving mother gives her son.
Yet, under even this mood, her laughter lay close to the surface, and nothing tapped its merry flow quicker than Paul's Spanish.
Picking up the language haphazard, he had somehow learned to apply the verb _tumblar_ to describe the pouring out of coffee, and he clung to it after correction with a persistence that surely inhered in his dogged German blood.
"_Tumbarlo el cafe_!"
he would say, and she would repeat it, faithfully mimicking his accent.
"Tumble out the coffee!"
following it with peals of laughter.
Or, turning up a saucy face, she would ask, "Shall I tumble out more coffee?"
and again the laughter which came as readily at her own misfit attempts at English.
These, few and simple, were learned of Bachelder's woman, and sprung on Paul as surprises on his return from visiting the mining properties, which required his frequent presence.
For instance, slipping to his knee on one such occasion, with the great heart of her pulsing against him, she sighed: "I love thee, lovest thou me?"
A lesson from Bachelder pleased him less.
Knowing Paul's pride in his German ancestry, and having been present when, in seasons of swollen pride, he had reflected invidiously in Andrea's presence on Mexico and all things Mexican, the artist, in a wicked moment, taught her to lisp "_Hoch der Kaiser_!"
_lese-majeste_ that almost caused Paul a fainting-fit.
"You shouldn't have taught her that," he said to Bachelder.
But the mischief was done.
Whenever, thereafter, through torment of insect or obsession of national pride, he animadverted on her country, she silenced him with the treasonable expression.
She learned other than English from Bachelder's woman, sweating out the dog days in Rosa's kitchen, experimenting with the barbaric dishes Gringos love.
She slaved for his comfort, keeping his linen, her house and self so spotlessly clean that as Paul's passion waned, affection grew up in its place--the respectful affection that, at home, would have afforded a permanent basis for a happy marriage.
When, a year later, their baby came, no northern benedict could have been more proudly happy.
Watching him playing with the child, Bachelder would wonder if his union also would terminate like all the others of his long experience.
In her, for it was a girl baby, Paul's fairness worked out, as she grew, in marvelous delicacies of cream and rose, weaving, moreover, a golden woof through the brown of her hair.
From her mother she took a lithe perfection of form.
At two she was well started for a raving beauty, and as much through his love for her as for Andrea, Paul had come, like Bachelder, to swear by the Tewana women.
He might have been swearing by them yet, but his company's business suddenly called him north, and no man could have bidden a white wife more affectionate farewell or have been more sure of his own return.
"It is a comfort to know that your woman won't go gadding while you are away, and that is more than a fellow can make sure of at home."
These were his last words to Bachelder.
He was to be absent two months, but after he had reported adversely on a mine in Sonora, he was ordered to expert a group in far Guerrera, where the mountains turn on edge and earth tosses in horrible tumult.
Then came a third order to report in New York for personal conference.
Thus the months did sums in simple addition while Andrea waited, serenely confident of his return.
Not that she lacked experience of deserted wives, or based hope on her own attractions.
Her furious mother love simply could not form, much less harbor, the possibility of Paul's deserting their pretty Lola.
And, barring her loneliness, the year was kind to her, feeding her mother love with small social triumphs.
For one, Lola was chosen to sit with three other tots, the most beautiful of Tewana's children, at the feet of the Virgin in the Theophany of the "Black Christ" at the eastern fiesta.
From morning to mirk midnight, it was a hard vigil.
By day the vaulted church reeked incense; by night a thousand candles guttered under the dark arches, sorely afflicting small, weary eyelids; yet Lola sat it out like a small thoroughbred, earning thereby the priest's kindly pat and her mother's devoted worship.
Then, on her third saint day, the small girl donned her first fiesta costume, a miniature of the heirlooms which descend from mother to daughter, each generation striving to increase the magnificence of the costume just as it strove to add to the gold pieces in the chain which did triple duty as hoard, dowry and necklace.
Andrea subtracted several English sovereigns from her own to start Lola's, and, with the American gold eagle, the gift of Bachelder, her _padrino_, godfather, they made an affluent beginning for so small a girl.
As for the costume?
Its silk, plush, velours, were worked by Andrea's clever fingers curiously and wondrously, even when judged by difficult Tewana standards.
Bachelder painted the small thing, kneeling by her mother's side before the great gold altar.
Her starched skirt, with its band of red velours, stands of itself leveling her head, so that she looks for all the world like a serious cherub peering out from a wonderfully embroidered bath-cabinet.
But ah!
the serious devotion of the faces!
The muse Bachelder had followed so faithfully was hovering closely when his soul flamed out upon that canvas.
It ranks with his "Enganchada."
Either would bring him fame, yet they rest, face to face, in a dusty locker, awaiting the day when time or death shall cure the ache that a glimpse of either brings him.
Two months after that canvas was put away, eighteen counting from the day of his departure, Bachelder walked, one day, down to the primitive post-office to see if the mail that was due from the little fishing port of Salina Cruz contained aught for him.
_Waded_ would better describe his progress, for it was the middle of the rains; water filled the air, dropping in sheets from a livid sky; the streets were rivers running full over the cobble curbs.
Such white planters as came in occasionally from the jungle country had been housefast upon their plantations for this month, and, having the town pretty much to himself, the artist's thought turned naturally to Paul, who used to bring doubtful mitigation to his isolation.
He had written the artist twice, but now six months had elapsed since the last letter.
"He'll never come back," the artist muttered.
"Poor Andrea!
But it is better--now."
Warm with the pity the thought inspired, he turned the corner into the street that led to the post-office, and was almost run down by the first mule of a train that came driving through the rain.
"Bachelder!"
the rider cried.
It was surely Paul.
Pulling up his beast, he thrust a wet hand from under his rain poncha, then, turning in his saddle, he spoke to the woman who rode behind him, "Ethel, this is Mr.
Bachelder."
The alternative had happened!
As a small hand thrust back the hood of mackintosh, Bachelder found himself staring at a sweet face, while an equally sweet greeting was drowned by echoing questions in his mind.
"Good God!"
he first thought.
"Why did he bring her here?"
And upon that immediately followed, "How ever did he get her?"
An evening spent with the pair at the small Mexican hotel increased his wonder.
Pleasant, pretty, of a fine sensibility and intellectual without loss of femininity, the girl would have been fitly mated with a man of the finest clay.
How could she have married Paul?
Bachelder thought, and correctly, that he discerned the reason in a certain warmth of romantic feeling that tinged her speech and manner.
Daughter of an Episcopal clergyman in Paul's native town, she had sighed for something different from the humdrum of small teas, dinners, parochial calls, and when Paul came to her with the glamour of tropical travel upon him, she married, mistaking the glamour for him.
"She loved me for the dangers I had passed!"
the artist mused, quoting Shakespeare, on his way home.
"What a tragedy when she discovers him for a spurious Othello!"
Dropping into the studio next morning, Paul answered the other question.
"Why not?"
he asked, with a touch of ancestral stolidity.
"My work is here.
Andrea?"
His next words plainly revealed that while his moral plating had cracked and peeled under tropical heat, the iron convention beneath had held without fracture.
He began: "It was a beastliness that we committed----"

"That _you_ committed," Bachelder sharply corrected.
"And what of the child?"
Blinking in the old fashion, Paul went on, "I was coming to that.
She cannot be allowed to grow up a little Mexican.
I shall adopt her and have her properly educated."
Here he looked at Bachelder as though expecting commendation for his honorable intention, and, receiving none, went on, dilating on his plans for the child as if resolved to earn it.
Yet, setting aside this patent motive, it was easy to see as he warmed to his subject that Andrea had not erred in counting on Lola to bring him back.
With her beauty she would do any man proud!
The whole United States would not be able to produce her rival!
She should have the best that money could give her!
Wondering at the curious mixture of class egotism, paternal tenderness and twisted morality, Bachelder listened to the end, then said, "Of course, Mrs. Steiner approves of a ready-made family?"
Paul's proud feathers draggled a little, and he reddened.
"Well--you see--she thinks Lola is the daughter of a dead mining friend.
Some day, of course, I'll tell her.
In fact, the knowledge will grow on her.
But not now.
It wouldn't do.
She couldn't understand."
"No?"
But the quiet sarcasm was wasted on Paul, and the artist continued, "Aren't you leaving Andrea out of your calculations?"
Paul ruffled like an angry gobbler.
His eyes took on an ugly gleam, his jaw stuck out, his expression incarnated Teutonic obstinacy.
"Oh, she'll have to be fixed.
Luckily it doesn't take much to buy these savage women; their feelings are all on the surface.
I'll give her the house, furniture, and a hundred dollars cash.
That should make up for the loss of----"

"----a husband?"
Bachelder's face darkened.
Throughout the conversation he had worn an air of suppression, as though holding, by an effort, something back.
Now he straightened with a movement that was analogous to the flexure of a coiled spring.
His lips opened, closed again, and he went on with his quiet questioning.
"For a husband, yes.
They are easy stock to come by.
But not for the child of her labor.
Supposing she refuses?"
Paul's eyes glinted under his frown.
"Then the Jefe-Politico earns the hundred dollars and the law gives her to me."
The spring uncoiled.
"Never!
She died a month ago of yellow fever."
Under Teuton phlegm lies an hysteria that rivals that of the Latin races.
Paul's flame died to ashes and he burst out sobbing, throwing his hands up and out with ungainly gestures.
Looking down upon his awkward grief, Bachelder half regretted the just anger that caused him to slip the news like a lightning bolt; he would have felt sorrier but that he perceived Paul's sorrow rooted in the same colossal egotism that would have sacrificed the mother on the altars of its vast conceit.
He knew that Paul was grieving for himself, for lost sensations of pride, love and pleasure that he could never experience again.
When the ludicrous travesty had partly spent itself, he stemmed the tide with a question.
"If you don't care to see Andrea, I can make the settlements you hinted at."
Paul glanced up, stupidly resentful, through his tears.
"The child is dead.
That is all off."
"You will do nothing for her?"
As much to prop an opinion of human nature that was already too low for comfort as in Andrea's interest, Bachelder asked the question.
"She has the house furnishings," Paul sullenly answered.
"That leaves her a sight better off than she was before she knew me."
Rising, the artist walked over to the window.
"The river is rising," he said, when he could trust himself to speak.
"Another foot, and away goes the bridge.
When do you go to the mine?"
"Tomorrow."
"Mrs. Steiner goes with you?"
"No, too wet."
Bachelder hesitated.
"I'd offer you my quarters, but--you see I am neither married nor unmarried."
"No!"
Paul agreed with ponderous respectability.
"It would never do.
Besides, I've hired a house of the Jefe-Politico; the one that crowns the Promontory.
When the rain slacks we'll move out to the mine."
"There is one thing I should like," he added as he rose to go.
"If you would have a stone put over the child's grave--something nice--you're a better judge than me,--I'll----"

"Too late," the artist interrupted.
"Andrea broke up her necklace; put savings of eighteen generations into the finest tomb in the cemetery."
He looked curiously at Paul, but his was that small order of mind which persistently fixes responsibility for the most inevitable calamity upon some person.
To the day of his death he would go on taxing the child's death against Andrea; he did not even comment on this last proof of her devoted love.
After he was gone, Bachelder returned to his window, just in time to see the bridge go.
A thin stream in summer, meandering aimlessly between wide banks, the river now ran a full half-mile wide, splitting the town with its yeasty race.
An annual occurrence, this was a matter of small moment to the severed halves.
Each would pursue the even tenor of its way till the slack of the rains permitted communication by canoe and the rebuilding of the bridge.
But it had special significance now in that Andrea lived on the other bank.
He wondered if the news of Paul's return had crossed, muttering: "Poor girl, poor girl!"
Adding, a moment later: "But happier than the other.
Poor little Desdemona!"
*       *       *       *       *

How melancholy is the voice of a flood!
Its resurgent dirge will move a new-born babe to frightened wailing, and stirs in strong men a vague uneasiness that roots in the vast and calamitous experience of the race.
Call of hungry waters, patter of driving rain, sough of the weird wind, it requires good company and a red-coal fire to offset their moanings of eternity.
Yet though the fireless tropics could not supply one, and she lacked the other, the storm voices were hardly responsible for Ethel Steiner's sadness the third morning after her arrival.
Neither was it due to the fact that Paul had failed to come in the preceding night from the mine.
Seeming relieved rather than distressed, she had gone quietly to bed.
No, it was neither the storm, his absence, nor any of the small miseries that afflict young wives.
Poor Desdemona!
The curtain was rising early on the tragedy which Bachelder foresaw.
Already the glamour was falling from Paul to the tropics, where it rightfully belonged; this morning she was living her bitter hour, fighting down the premonition of a fatal mistake.
What with her thoughtful pauses, she made but a slow toilet, and when the last rebellious curl had been coaxed to its place behind her small ear, she turned, sighing, to the window.
One glance, and she started back, pale, clutching her hands.
A rocky snout, thrusting far out into the belly of the river's great bow, the Promontory stood high above the ordinary flood level.
Once, in far-away Aztec times, a Tewana tradition had it that a cloudburst in the rains had swept it clear of houses, and now Time's slow cycle had brought the same deadly coincidence.
Where, last night, a hundred lights had flickered below her windows, a boil of yellow waters spread, cutting off her house, the last and highest, from the mainland.
Black storm had drowned the cries of fleeing householders.
The flood's mighty voice, bellowing angrily for more victims as it swallowed house after house, had projected but a faint echo into her dreams.
Now, however, she remembered that Carmencita, her new maid, had failed to bring in the morning coffee.
Wringing her hands and loudly lamenting the deadly fear that made her forget her mistress, Carmencita, poor girl, was in the crowd that was helping Paul and Bachelder to launch a freight canoe.
When Paul--who had ridden in early from the little village, where he had been storm-stayed--had tried to impress a crew, the peon boatman had sworn volubly that no pole would touch bottom and that one might as well try to paddle the town as a heavy canoe against such a flood.
But when Bachelder stepped in and manned the big sweep, a half-dozen followed.
Notwithstanding, their river wisdom proved.
Paddling desperately, they gained no nearer than fifty yards to the pale face at the window.
"Don't be afraid!"
Bachelder shouted, as they swept by.
"We'll get you next time!"
If the walls did not melt?
Already the flood was licking with hungry tongues the adobe bricks where the plaster had bulged and fallen, and an hour would fly while they made a landing and dragged the canoe back for another cast.
The boatmen knew!
Their faces expressed, anticipated that which happened as they made the landing half a mile below.
Paul saw it first.
Through the swift passage he sat, facing astern, helplessly clutching the gunwale, and his cry, raucous as that of a maimed animal, signaled the fall of the house.
Sobbing, he collapsed on the bank.
Bachelder looked down upon him.
Momentarily stunned, his thought returned along with a feeling of relief that would have framed itself thus in words: "Poor Desdemona!
Now she will never know!"
"_Senor!
Senor!
Mira!_" A boatman touched his shoulder.
Two heads were swirling down the flood, a light and a dark.
Bachelder instantly knew Ethel, but, as yet, he could not make out the strong swimmer who was at such infinite pains to hold the fair head above water.
Though, time and again, the dark head went under for smotheringly long intervals, Ethel's never once dipped, and, up or down, the swimmer battled fiercely, angling across the flood.
She--for long hair stamped her a woman--gained seventy yards shoreward while floating down two hundred.
Three hundred gave her another fifty.
So, rising and sinking, she drifted with her burden down upon Paul and Bachelder.
At fifty yards the artist caught a glimpse of her face, but not till she was almost under their hands did Paul recognize the swimmer.
"Andrea!"
he shouted.
*       *       *       *       *

Reassured by Bachelder's cheery shout, Ethel had busied herself collecting her watch and other trinkets from the bureau till a smacking of wet feet caused her to turn, startled.
A woman stood in the door, a woman of matchless amplitudes, such as of old tempted the gods from heaven.
Stark naked, save for the black cloud that dripped below her waist, her bronze beauty was framed by the ponderous arch.
"I don't know who you are," Ethel said, recovering, "but you are very beautiful, and, under the circumstances, welcome.
Under ordinary conditions, your advent would have been a trifle embarrassing.
I must find you a shawl before the canoes come.
Here, take this blanket."
She little imagined how embarrassing the visitation might have proved under very ordinary conditions.
Though the news of Paul's return did cross before the bridge was carried away, Andrea did not hear it till that morning, and she would never have had it from a Tewana neighbor.
They pitied the bereavement to which widowhood in the most cruel of forms was now added.
But among them she unfortunately counted a peon woman of the upper Mexican plateau, one of the class which took from the Conquest only Spanish viciousness to add to Aztec cruelty.
Jealous of Andrea's luck--as they had deemed it--in marriage, Pancha had thirsted for the opportunity which came as they drew water together that morning from the brink of the flood.
"'Tis the luck of us all!"
she exclaimed, malevolently ornamenting her evil tidings.
"They take their pleasure of us, these Gringos, then when the hide wrinkles, ho for a prettier!
They say Tewana hath not such another as his new flame, and thy house is a hovel to that he fits up for her on the Promontory."
Here the hag paused, for two good reasons.
That the barbed shaft might sink deep and rankle from Andrea's belief that her supplanter was a girl of her tribe, but principally because, just then, she went down under the ruins of her own _olla_.
A fighter, after her kind, with many a cutting to her credit, she cowered like a snarling she-wolf among the sharp potsherds cowed by the enormous anger she had provoked; lay and watched while the tall beauty ripped shawl, slip and skirt from her magnificent limbs, then turned and plunged into the flood.
Pancha rose and shook her black fist, hurling curses after.
"May the alligators caress thy limbs, the fishes pluck thine eyes, the wolves crack thy bleached bones on the strand."
That was the lightest of them, but, unheeding Andrea swam on.
As her own house stood in the extreme skirt of the town, the Promontory lay more than a mile below, but she could see neither it nor the night's devastation because of the river's bend.
Because of the same bend, she had the aid of the current, which set strongly over to the other shore, but apart from this the river was one great danger.
Floating logs, huge trees, acres of tangled greenery, the sweepings of a hundred miles of jungle, covered its surface with other and ghastlier trove.
Here the saurians of Pancha's curse worried a drowned pig, there they fought over a cow's swollen carcass; yet because of carrion taste or food plethora, they let her by.
There an enormous saber, long and thick as a church, turned and tumbled, threshing air and water with enormous spreading branches, creating dangerous swirls and eddies.
These she avoided, and, having swum the river at ebb and flood every day of her life from a child, she now easily clove its roar and tumble; swam on, her heat unabated by the water's chill, till, sweeping around the bend, she sighted the lone house on the Promontory.
That gave her pause.
Had death, then, robbed her anger?
The thought broke the spring of her magnificent energy.
Feeling at last the touch of fatigue, she steered straight for the building and climbed in, to rest, at a lower window, without a thought of its being occupied till Ethel moved above.
Who shall divine her thoughts as, standing there in the door, she gazed upon her rival?
Did she not recognize her as such, or was she moved by the touch of sorrow, aftermath of the morning's bitterness, that still lingered on the young wife's face?
Events seemed to predicate the former, but, be that as it may, the eyes which grief and despair had heated till they flamed like small crucibles of molten gold, now cooled to their usual soft brown; smiling, she refused the proffered blanket.
"_Ven tu!
Ven tu!_" she exclaimed, beckoning.
Her urgent accent and gesture carried her meaning, and without question Ethel followed down to a lower window.
"But the canoe?"
she objected, when Andrea motioned for her to disrobe.
"It will soon be here!"
"_Canoa_?"
From the one word Andrea caught her meaning.
"_No hay tiempo.
Mira!_"

Leaning out, Ethel looked and shrank back, her inexperience convinced by a single glance at the wall.
She assisted the strong hands to rip away her encumbering skirts.
It took only a short half-minute, and with that afforded time for a small femininity to come into play.
Placing her own shapely arm against Ethel's, Andrea murmured soft admiration at the other's marvelous whiteness.
But it was done in a breath.
Slipping an arm about Ethel's waist, Andrea jumped with her from the window, one minute before the soaked walls collapsed.
If Ethel's head had remained above, she might have retained her presence of mind, and so have made things easier for her saviour, but, not supposing that the whole world contained a mature woman who could not swim, Andrea loosed her as they took the water.
A quick dive partially amended the error, retrieving Ethel, but not her composure.
Coming up, half-choked, she grappled Andrea, and the two went down together.
The Tewana could easily have broken the white girl's grip and--have lost her.
Instead, she held her breath and presently brought her senseless burden to the surface.
Of itself, the struggle was but a small thing to her strength, but coming on top of the long swim under the shock and play of emotion, it left her well nigh spent.
Yet she struggled shoreward, battling, waging the war of the primal creature that yields not till Death himself reenforces bitter odds.
To this exhaustion, the tales that float in Tehuantepec lay her end, and Bachelder has never taken time to contradict them.
But as she floated almost within reach of his hand, she steadied at Paul's shout as under an accession of sudden strength, and looked at her erstwhile husband.
Then, if never before, she knew--him, as well as his works!
From him her glance flashed to the fair face at her shoulder.
What power of divination possessed her?
Or was it Bachelder's fancy?
He swears to the chosen few, the few who understand, that her face lit with the same glory of tender pity that she held over her sick child.
Then, before they could reach her, she shot suddenly up till her bust gleamed wet to the waist, turned, and dived, carrying down the senseless bride.
Shouting, Bachelder also dived--in vain.
In vain, the dives of his men.
Death, that mighty potentate, loves sweetness full well as a shining mark.
Swiftly, silently, a deep current bore them far out on the flooded lands and there scoured a sepulcher safe from saurian teeth, beyond the scope Pancha's curse.
Later, the jungle flowed in after the receding waters and wreathed over the twin grave morning-glories pure as the white wife, glorious orchids rich as Andrea's bronze.
